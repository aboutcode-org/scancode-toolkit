MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO CODE

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named
above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
software, except to the extent those have additional terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

a. General. You may use any number of copies of the software to develop and test
your applications, including deployment within your internal corporate network.

b. Demo use. The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating
your applications.

c. Backup copy. You may make one or more backup copies of the software, for
reinstalling the software.

d. Third Party Programs. The software may include third party components with
separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as described in the
ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software. Even if such components are
governed by other agreements, the disclaimers and the limitations on and
exclusions of damages below also apply.

The software contains third party components licensed under open source licenses
with source code availability obligations. Copies of those licenses are included
in the ThirdPartyNotices file or accompanying credits file. You may obtain the
complete corresponding source code from us if and as required under the relevant
open source licenses by sending a money order or check for $5.00 to: Source Code
Compliance Team, Microsoft Corporation, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.
Please write &#34;third party source code for Visual Studio Code&#34; in the memo line
of your payment. We may also make the source available at
http://thirdpartysource.microsoft.com/.

e. Extensions.The software gives you the option to download other Microsoft and
third party software packages from our extension marketplace or package
managers. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement.
Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the
third party packages.

2. DATA. The software may collect information about you and your use of the
software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to
provide services and improve our products and services. There may also be some
features in the software that enable you to collect data from users of your
applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your
applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing
appropriate notices to users of your applications.

You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and
the privacy statement at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&amp;clcid=0x409. Your use of the
software operates as your consent to these practices.

3. UPDATES. The software may install automatic updates. By using the software,
you agree to receive automatic updates without any additional notice, and permit
Microsoft to download and install them for you. If you do not want automatic
updates, you may turn them off by following the instructions in the
documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397.

4. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to
Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your
feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is
subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or
documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These
rights survive this agreement.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use
the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you
must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you
to use it in certain ways. You may not

* work around any technical limitations in the software;

* reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt
to derive the source code for the software except, and solely to the extent: (i)
permitted by applicable law, despite this limitation; or (ii) required to debug
changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
which are included with and linked to by the software;

* remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in
the software;

* use the software in any way that is against the law; or

* share, publish, or lend the software, or provide it as a hosted solution for
others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is &#34;as is,&#34; we may not provide
support services for it.

7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.

8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. Microsoft software, online services, professional
services and related technology are subject to U.S. export jurisdiction. You
must comply with all applicable international and national laws including the
U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction programs, and end-user,
end use and destination restrictions by the U.S. and other governments related
to Microsoft products, services and technologies. For additional information,
see http://www.microsoft.com/exporting.

9. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington
law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and
the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired
the software in any other country, its laws apply.

10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
other rights under the laws of your state or country. This agreement does not
change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. Without limiting the foregoing, for
Australia, YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND
NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED &#34;AS-IS.&#34;&#34; YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT.

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND
ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER
DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental, consequential or other damages.
