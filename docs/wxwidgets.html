Copyright (C) 1997 Julian Smart, Markus Holzem

Preamble

This licence is intended to protect wxWidgets, its developers, and its users, so
that the considerable investment it represents is not abused.

Unlike the wxWidgets licence, you as a user are not obliged to distribute
wxWidgets source code with your products. However, you are prevented from
selling the code without permission from the authors, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWidgets in the way intended.

The wxWidgets Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors for this
or derived code.

Finally, the licence specifies that any patent involving wxWidgets, must be
licenced for everyone&#39;s free use.

 wxWidgets Licence

Terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

1. This Licence Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this wxWidgets Licence (also called &#34;this
Licence&#34;). Each licencee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;.

A &#34;library&#34; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The &#34;Library&#34;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A &#34;work based on the Library&#34; means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term &#34;modification&#34;.)

&#34;Source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this Licence; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this Licence
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this Licence along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you cause the files
modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
date of any change. With agreement from the authors of wxWidgets, you may charge
for value added to the Library, for example, a commercially supported version,
or a port to a new platform. It is expected that collaboration between such
commercial interests and the free wxWidgets community will yield benefits to
both parties, since wxWidgets represents a substantial investment of time and
effort. It is not in the spirit of this agreement that commercial exploitation
of wxWidgets should in any way detract from the free version.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library in object code or derived library
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicence, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicence, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this Licence. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this Licence will not have their
licences terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

6. You are not required to accept this Licence, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this Licence. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this Licence to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Library or works based on it.

7. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a licence from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39;
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this Licence.

8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this Licence, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
Licence. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this Licence and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
licence would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this Licence would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public licence practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licencee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this Licence.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this Licence may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this Licence incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
Licence.

10. The authors of wxWidgets may publish revised and/or new versions of the
wxWidgets Licence from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this Licence which applies to it and &#34;any later version&#34;,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the wxWidgets authors. If the Library does
not specify a licence version number, you may choose any version ever published
by the wxWidgets authors.

11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the program
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the wxWidgets
authors, write to the wxWidgets authors. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

12. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENCED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &#34;AS
IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &#34;copyright&#34; line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the wxWidgets Licence; either

version 2 of the Licence, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the wxWidgets Licence for more details.

You should have received a copy of the wxWidgets Licence along with this
library; if not, write to julian@wxwidgets.org.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a &#34;copyright disclaimer&#34; for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob&#39; (a
library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
