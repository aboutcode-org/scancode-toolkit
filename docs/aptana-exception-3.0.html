conveyed to you by Appcelerator, Inc. and licensed under one or more of the
licenses identified in the Excepted License List below (each an &#34;Excepted
License&#34;), as long as:
1. you obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the modified
version, except for Excepted Works which are identifiable sections of the
modified version, which are not derived from the Program, and which can
reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves,
2. all Excepted Works which are identifiable sections of the modified
version, which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably
be considered independent and separate works in themselves,
1. are distributed subject to the Excepted License under which they were
originally licensed, and
2. are not themselves modified from the form in which they are conveyed to
you by Aptana, and
3. the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections,
on the same medium as the corresponding object code or executable forms of
those sections, and are licensed under the applicable Excepted License as
the corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and
3. any works which are aggregated with the Program, or with a modified
version on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with
the GPL, are aggregates (as defined in Section 5 of the GPL) which can
reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves and
which are not modified versions of either the Program, a modified version,
or an Excepted Work.
If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,
modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or
