In addition, this license will terminate immediately without notice from Oracle or Greg Luck if you fail to comply with any provision of this license. Upon termination, you must cease use of or destroy the Specification. &#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; means the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;, &#34;javax&#34;, &#34;com.oracle&#34; or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle or Greg Luck through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof
