  intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
  its utilization under this License), USER must include a text file
  with the source code provided to UNIVERSITY titled &#34;LEGAL&#34; which
  describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
  detail that UNIVERSITY will know whom to contact. If USER obtains
  such knowledge after USER makes the Modification available to
  UNIVERSITY, USER shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
  USER makes available thereafter and shall notify UNIVERSITY that new
  knowledge has been obtained.

  (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
  programming interface and USER owns or controls patents, which are
  reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
  this information in the LEGAL file.

3.2. Required Notices. USER must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
  each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
  for the Source Code, where USER describes recipients&#39; rights
  relating to Covered Code. If USER created one or more
  Modification(s), USER may add name as a Contributor to the notice
  described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
  a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then USER must
  include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
  file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

3.3. Distribution of Executable Versions. - This license does not
  allow distribution of the Covered Code by USER or Contributor.

3.4. Larger Works. USER may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License. In
  such a case, USER must make sure the requirements of this License
  are fulfilled for the Covered Code including 2.1d and 2.1e.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for USER to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
  statute or regulation then USER must:

  possible; and

  (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
  description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
  3.1 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
  Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
  description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
  ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to Covered Code attached to the notice in Exhibit A.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
  PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7. TERMINATION.

  automatically if USER fails to comply with terms herein. All
  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
  survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
  shall survive.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE
  UNIVERSITY, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
  CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO USER OR

  PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION
  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.
