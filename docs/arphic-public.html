Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is forbidden.

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and
   change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and
   encourages you to use this software, provided that you give the recipients all the
   rights that we gave you and make sure they can get the modifications of this
   software.

Legal Terms

0. Definitions:

   Throughout this License, &#34;Font&#34; means the TrueType fonts &#34;AR PL Mingti2L Big5&#34;,
   &#34;AR PL KaitiM Big5&#34; (BIG-5 character set) and &#34;AR PL SungtiL GB&#34;, &#34;AR PL KaitiM
   GB&#34; (GB character set) which are originally distributed by Arphic, and the
   derivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying
   glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting
   some characters in/from glyph table.

   &#34;PL&#34; means &#34;Public License&#34;.

   &#34;Copyright Holder&#34; means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
   Font.

   &#34;You&#34; means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font.

   &#34;Freely Available&#34; means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as
   well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received,
   not price. If you wish, you can charge for this service.

1. Copying &amp; Distribution

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any medium, without
   restriction, provided that you retain this license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered
   in all copies.

2. Modification

   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including modifying
   glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting
   some characters in/from glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications
   under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions are
   met:

   a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when
   you changed that file.

   b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all third
   parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to copy the
   modifications from a designated place, or distributing the modifications on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.

   c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
   cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
   to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
   a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
   and that users may redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the
   user how to view a copy of this License.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
   of that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably considered
   independent and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms, do
   not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore,
   mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a volume
   of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
   of this License.

3. Condition Subsequent
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except as expressly
   provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
   distribute the Font will automatically retroactively void your rights under this
   License. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
   License will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.

4. Acceptance
   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
   However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or
   distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
   License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font,
   you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.

5. Automatic Receipt
   Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font subject
   to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
   enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

6. Contradiction
   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or
   for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
   (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
   this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
   cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
   distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive copies directly
   or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
   section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

7. NO WARRANTY
   BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO
   THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
   THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
   RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

8. DAMAGES WAIVER
   UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY
   COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT
   AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
   USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
   SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</code></pre>
