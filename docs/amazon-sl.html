The terms &#34;reproduce,&#34; &#34;reproduction,&#34; &#34;derivative works,&#34; and &#34;distribution&#34; have the meaning as provided under U.S. copyright law; provided, however, that for the purposes of this License, derivative works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work.

Works, including the Software, are &#34;made available&#34; under this License by including in or with the Work either (a) a copyright notice referencing the applicability of this License to the Work, or (b) a copy of this License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense and distribute its Work and any resulting derivative works in any form.

2.2 Patent Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer its Work, in whole or in part. The foregoing license applies only to the patent claims licensable by Licensor that would be infringed by Licensor’s Work (or portion thereof) individually and excluding any combinations with any other materials or technology.

3. Limitations

3.1 Redistribution. You may reproduce or distribute the Work only if (a) you do so under this License, (b) you include a complete copy of this License with your distribution, and (c) you retain without modification any copyright, patent, trademark, or attribution notices that are present in the Work.

3.2 Derivative Works. You may specify that additional or different terms apply to the use, reproduction, and distribution of your derivative works of the Work (&#34;Your Terms&#34;) only if (a) Your Terms provide that the use limitation in Section 3.3 applies to your derivative works, and (b) you identify the specific derivative works that are subject to Your Terms. Notwithstanding Your Terms, this License (including the redistribution requirements in Section 3.1) will continue to apply to the Work itself.

3.3 Use Limitation. The Work and any derivative works thereof only may be used or intended for use with the web services, computing platforms or applications provided by Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates, including Amazon Web Services LLC.

3.4 Patent Claims. If you bring or threaten to bring a patent claim against any Licensor (including any claim, cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) to enforce any patents that you allege are infringed by any Work, then your rights under this License from such Licensor (including the grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2) will terminate immediately.

3.5 Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use any Licensor’s or its affiliates’ names, logos, or trademarks, except as necessary to reproduce the notices described in this License.
