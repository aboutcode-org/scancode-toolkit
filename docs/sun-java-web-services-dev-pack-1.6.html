LICENSE TO EVALUATE EA SOFTWARE: The Binary Code License Agreement (&#34;BCL&#34;) and the Evaluation Terms (&#34;Evaluation Terms&#34;) below shall apply to the portions of the Software identified as Early Access in the Software&#39;s Release Notes. The BCL and the Evaluation Terms shall collectively be referred to as the Evaluation Agreement (&#34;Evaluation Agreement&#34;). 

LICENSE TO USE FCS SOFTWARE: The BCL and the Supplemental Terms (&#34;Supplemental Terms&#34;) provided following the BCL shall apply to portions of the Software identified as FCS Software in the Software&#39;s Release Notes. BCL and the Supplemental Terms shall collectively be referred to as the Agreement (&#34;Agreement&#34;). 


EVALUATION TERMS

The terms of the Evaluation Agreement shall apply to portions of Software identified as Early Access in the Software&#39;s Release Notes (&#34;Software&#34;). These Evaluation Terms add to or modify the terms of the BCL. Capitalized terms not defined in these Evaluation Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the BCL. These Evaluation Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms in the BCL below, or in any license contained within the Software.  

I. LICENSE TO EVALUATE. Sun grants to you, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free and limited license to use one (1) copy of the Software internally for the purposes of evaluation only for one hundred eighty (180) days after the date you download the Software from Sun (&#34;Evaluation Period&#34;). No license is granted to you for any other purpose. You may not sell, rent, loan or otherwise encumber or transfer the Software in whole or in part, to any third party. Licensee shall have no right to use the Software for productive or commercial use. 

II. DUTIES. You agree to evaluate and test the Software for use in your software environment and provide feedback to Sun in a manner reasonably requested by Sun. Any and all test results, error data, reports or other information, feedback or materials made or provided by you relating to Software (collectively, &#34;Feedback&#34;) is the exclusive property of Sun and you hereby assigns all Feedback to Sun at no cost to Sun. Sun may use such Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, without limitation, liability or obligation to you. 

III. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. For purposes of the Evaluation Agreement, &#34;Confidential Information&#34; means: (i) business and technical information and any source code or binary code, which Sun discloses to Licensee related to Software; (ii) Licensee&#39;s feedback based on Software; and (iii) the terms, conditions, and existence of this Agreement. Licensee may not disclose or use Confidential Information, except for the purposes specified in this Agreement. You will protect the Confidential Information with the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, as Licensee uses to protect its own Confidential Information.

Your obligations regarding Confidential Information will expire no less than five (5) years from the date of receipt of the Confidential Information, except for Sun source code which will be protected in perpetuity. You agree that Software contains Sun trade secrets. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement concerning nondisclosure and non-use of the Confidential Information, the nondisclosure obligations of this section will not apply to any portion of Confidential Information that you can demonstrate in writing is: (i) now, or hereafter through no act or failure to act on the part of you becomes, generally known to the public; (ii) known to you at the time of receiving the Confidential Information without an obligation of confidentiality; (iii) hereafter rightfully furnished to you by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) independently developed by you without any use ofthe Confidential Information. 

IV. TERMINATION AND/OR EXPIRATION. Upon expiration of the Evaluation Period, unless terminated earlier by Sun, you agree to immediately cease use of and destroy Software.  Either party may terminate this Evaluation Agreement upon ten (10) days&#39; written notice to the other party. However, Sun may terminate this Evaluation Agreement immediately should any Software become, or in Sun&#39;s opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent, trade secret or copyright. Sun may terminate this Evaluation Agreement immediately should you materially breach any of its provisions or take any action in derogation of Sun&#39;s rights to the Confidential Information licensed to you. Upon termination or expiration of this Evaluation Agreement, you will immediately cease use of and destroy Software, any copies thereof and provide to Sun a written statement certifying that you have complied with the foregoing obligations. Rights and obligations under this Evaluation Agreement which by their nature should survive, will remain in effect after termination or expiration hereof.

V. NO SUPPORT. Sun is under no obligation to support Software or to provide upgrades or error corrections (&#34;Software Updates&#34;) to the Software. If Sun, at its sole option, supplies Software Updates to you, the Software Updates will be considered part of Software, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

VI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Licensee acknowledges that the Software may be experimental and that the Software may have defects or deficiencies, which cannot or will not be corrected by Sun.  Licensee will hold Sun harmless from any claims based on Licensee&#39;s use of the Software for any purposes other than those of internal evaluation, and from any claims that later versions or releases of any Software furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement.
