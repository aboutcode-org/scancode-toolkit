Corporation for the Microsoft software that accompanies this EULA, which includes
computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, &#34;online&#34; or
electronic documentation, and Internet-based services (&#34;Software&#34;). An amendment or
addendum to this EULA may accompany the Software. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND
BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE
USING THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, OR
USE THE SOFTWARE; YOU MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE (IF
APPLICABLE) FOR A FULL REFUND.

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the following rights provided that you
comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA: a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty
free right and license to use an unlimited number of copies of the Software on
computers, including workstations, terminals, or other devices and redistribute the
Software in object code only provided that each copy is a true and complete copy of the
Software including the license.txt file.

2.	ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS -- REDISTRIBUTABLE CODE. In addition to the
rights granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software, as described in this Section
2, are provided to you with additional license rights. These additional license rights are
conditioned upon your compliance with the distribution requirements and license
restrictions described in Section 3.

2.1	Redistributable Code--General. Microsoft grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free
right to reproduce and distribute the object code form of any portion of the Software
listed in REDIST.TXT (&#34;Redistributable Code&#34;). For general redistribution requirements
for Redistributable Code, see Section 3.1, below.

3.	LICENSE RESTRICTIONS -- DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. If you choose to
exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by you is subject to your
compliance with the following terms.

3.1	If you are authorized and choose to redistribute Redistributable Code as described
in Section 2, you agree: (i) to distribute the Software only in object code form and only
in conjunction with and as a part of your hardware products (&#34;Licensee Product&#34;) which
are designed to operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems;
(ii) to distribute the Licensee Product containing the Redistributable Code pursuant to
an end user license agreement (which may be &#34;break-the-seal&#34;, &#34;click-wrap&#34; or signed),
with terms no less protective than those contained in this EULA; (iii) not to use
Microsoft&#39;s name, logo, or trademarks to market the Licensee Product; (iv) to display
your own valid copyright notice which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft&#39;s copyright
in the Software; (v) not to remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or patent notices

defend Microsoft from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney&#39;s fees, that
arise or result from the use or distribution of the Licensee Product; (vii) otherwise

expressly granted.
You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributable Code by your end
users except you may permit further redistribution of the Redistributable Code by your
distributors to your end-user customers if your distributors only distribute the
Redistributable Code in conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee Product and you
and your distributors comply with all other terms of this EULA.

3.2	If you use the Redistributable Code, then in addition to your compliance with the
applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributable Code, the
following also applies. Your license rights to the Redistributable Code are conditioned
upon your not (i) creating derivative works of the Redistributable Code in any manner
that would cause the Redistributable Code in whole or in part to become subject to any
of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) distributing the Redistributable Code (or
derivative works thereof) in any manner that would cause the Redistributable Code to
become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License. An &#34;Excluded License&#34; is
any license that requires as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution of
software subject to the Excluded License, that such software or other software
combined and/or distributed with such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source
code form; (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (z) redistributable
at no charge.
