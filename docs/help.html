      <dd>
        The unique identifier for the license in the ScanCode LicenseDB as assigned by scancode-toolkit.

        generally describing the relationship between the licensor and the licensee. These license categories are not
        legally precise, and are only intended to support Software Composition Analysis and usage policy implementations.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">owner</dt>
      <dd>
        An owner is an entity that is the original author or custodian of a software license, and which may be responsible

      <dd>The standard text to provide in source or documentation that identifies the license or exception that applies to the software.</dd>

    </h4>
    <dl>
      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Commercial</dt>
      <dd>
        A direct commercial license between a supplier and a customer.
        Further fact-finding by a Product Team will be necessary to determine how the license conditions apply to use of the software.
        This is a Proprietary license that is not Open Source.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Copyleft</dt>
      <dd>
        A license that offers irrevocable permission to the public to copy and redistribute the work in the same or modified form,
        but with the conditions that all such redistributions make the work available in a form that facilitates further modification
        and uses the same license terms. A Copyleft license can require code interacting with Copyleft-licensed code to be licensed under
        the same license or a compatible license. This is an Open Source license. This category may be described as “Strong Copyleft”.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Copyleft Limited</dt>
      <dd>
        A license that requires you to redistribute source code, including your changes, and to provide attribution for the software authors.
        Your obligation to redistribute source code, including proprietary code linked with code under this license,
        is limited according to license-specific rules. This  is an Open Source license. This category may be described as “Weak Copyleft”.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Free Restricted</dt>
      <dd>
        A Permissive-style license that contains restrictions regarding the usage of the software (e.g. where the software is not
        intended for use in nuclear power plants) or the redistribution of the software (e.g. where commercial redistribution of
        the software is not allowed or allowed only with express permission). The Free Software Foundation (FSF) says that a license
        with this kind of restriction is not really open source, although the OSI point of view is not that strict.
        This is a Proprietary license that is not Open Source.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Patent License</dt>
      <dd>
        A license that applies to patents rather than specific software. May be used in conjunction with other software license(s) that
        apply to a software component.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Permissive</dt>
      <dd>
        A license that requires you to provide attribution for the software authors and may include other conditions.
        This is an Open Source license.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Proprietary Free</dt>
      <dd>
        A license that does not require a supplier-customer contract, but has specific terms and conditions which a Product Team
        is obligated to follow. These terms and conditions may be documented in the code and/or from a webpage where you must accept
        the license (i.e. click-through). This is a Proprietary license that is not Open Source.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Public Domain</dt>
      <dd>
        “Public Domain” as a license category means software that is not restricted by copyright.
        This is most often applicable to a software component because the person entitled to control the copyright has disclaimed that
        right in a notice (“dedication”) that appears similar to a license. It is possible for software to be in the public domain
        because the copyright has expired, but this is rarely relevant for software due to the long duration of copyrights in most jurisdictions.
        The rules for disclaiming copyright and copyright expiration dates vary widely by jurisdiction.
        A public domain dedication may apply to software code examples on a website, published public domain specifications or
        another type of publication. Public Domain is typically treated as similar to an Open Source license even though it is not an
        Open Source license.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Source-available</dt>
      <dd>
        A license where the software is released through a source code distribution model that includes conditions where the source
        can be viewed, and in some cases modified, but without meeting the criteria to be called Open Source.
        The most common restriction is for “field of use”. This is a Proprietary license that is not Open Source.
      </dd>

      <dt class="chip bg-secondary">Unstated License</dt>
      <dd>
        “Unstated License” as a license category means third-party software that has a copyright notice, but no stated license.
        Common examples include code snippets from publications and websites. The absence of a license poses a risk that the copyright
        owner may assert license conditions at some future time. A Product Team may need to contact the copyright owner to determine the
        license conditions, if any.
