PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR USING THE PROGRAMS. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE PROGRAMS YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE LICENSE AGREEMENT (the &#34;AGREEMENT&#34;) BETWEEN YOU AND ALTERA CORPORATION (&#34;ALTERA&#34;) WITH REGARD TO THE PROGRAMS.

License Terms
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Altera grants to you a worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual license (with the right to grant sublicenses, and authorize sublicensees to sublicense further) to use, copy, prepare derivative works based on, and distribute the Programs and derivative works thereof, provided that any distribution or sublicense is subject to the same terms and conditions that you use for distribution of your own comparable software products. Any copies of the Programs or derivative works thereof will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You must include in any copies of the Programs or derivative works thereof any trademark, copyright, and other proprietary rights notices included in the Programs by Altera.

YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, USE, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMS.

YOUR SOLE REMEDIES AND ALTERA&#39;S ENTIRE LIABILITY ARE AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
