Definitions

&#34;Oracle&#34; refers to Oracle America, Inc. &#34;You&#34; and &#34;Your&#34; refers to (a) a company or organization (each an &#34;Entity&#34;) accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf of an Entity. &#34;Program(s)&#34; refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle pursuant to the following terms and any updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation provided by Oracle. &#34;Program Documentation&#34; refers to Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation. &#34;Separate Terms&#34; refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files and that apply to Separately Licensed Technology. &#34;Separately Licensed Technology&#34; refers to Oracle or third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and not under the terms of this license.

Separately Licensed Technology

Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with Oracle or third party technology provided as or with the Programs. If specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files, such technology will be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Technology shall be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under the terms of this license.

Source Code for Open Source Software

For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, You can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting a written request pursuant to the instructions in the &#34;Written Offer for Source Code&#34; section of the latter website.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not provided to You under Separate Terms.

License Rights and Restrictions

Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, subject to the conditions stated herein, a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to:

(a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and running the Program for Your own personal use or internal business operations; and

(b) redistribute the unmodified Program and Program Documentation, under the terms of this License, provided that You do not charge Your licensees any fees associated with such distribution or use of the Program, including, without limitation, fees for products that include or are bundled with a copy of the Program or for services that involve the use of the distributed Program.

You may make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary for exercising the license rights granted herein and for backup purposes. You are granted the right to use the Programs to provide third party training in the use of the Programs and associated Separately Licensed Technology only if there is express authorization of such use by Oracle on the Program&#39;s download page or in the Program Documentation.

Your license is contingent on compliance with the following conditions:

- You do not remove markings or notices of either Oracle&#39;s or a licensor&#39;s proprietary rights from the Programs or Program Documentation;

- You comply with all U.S. and applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations that govern Your use of the Programs (including technical data);

- You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You nor allow an associated party to do so.

For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution with the Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may not be modified, unless such source code is under Separate Terms permitting modification.

Ownership

Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Programs.

Information Collection

The Programs&#39; installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may transmit a limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider about those processes to help Oracle understand and optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data with personally identifiable information. Refer to Oracle&#39;s Privacy Policy at www.oracle.com/privacy.
