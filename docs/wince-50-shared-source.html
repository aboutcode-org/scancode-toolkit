Also, you must pass this limitation of liability on whenever you distribute the Software.
   9. That if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to this Software for a person&#39;s use of this Software, your license to this Software ends automatically.
  10.

If You or Your affiliates choose to assert Your Patents against OEM/ODM Licensees on account of the OEM/ODM Licensees making, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or other disposition or promotion of Windows CE, portion thereof, or a redistributed portion thereof, then You and Your affiliates agree to offer licenses to such OEM/ODM Licensees under commercially reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and pricing.
  11. If You assign any of Your Patents or rights to enforce any of Your Patents, You will require that the assignee(s) agree to be bound by this Section. Any such assignment by You not in accordance with this Section will be null and void.
