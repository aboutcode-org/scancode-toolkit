Good First Issue
----------------

A `good first issue <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/labels/good%20first%20issue>`_
means it's recommended for people who haven't contributed to our codebase before.

A ``Solving Good First Issue`` is basically an issue based guide for new contributors to
solve a ``Good First Issue``.

Manitainers of ScanCode Toolkit label small bugs as good first issues for new contributors.
