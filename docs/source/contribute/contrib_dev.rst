Code layout and conventions
---------------------------

Source code is in ``src/`` Tests are in ``tests/``.

There is one Python package for each major feature under ``src/`` and a corresponding directory
with the same name under ``tests`` (but this is not a package by design).

Each test script is named ``test_XXXX`` and while we love to use ``py.test`` as a test runner,
most tests have no dependencies on ``py.test``, only on the ``unittest`` module (with the exception
of some command line tests that depend on pytest monkeypatching capabilities.

When source or tests need data files, we store these in a ``data`` subdirectory.

We use PEP8 conventions with a relaxed line length that can be up to 90'ish characters long when
needed to keep the code clear and readable.

We store pre-built bundled native binaries in ``bin/`` sub-directories of each ``src/`` packages.
These binaries are organized by OS and architecture. This ensures that ScanCode works out of the box
either using a checkout or a download, without needing a compiler and toolchain to be installed.
The corresponding source code for the pre-built binaries are stored in a separate repository at
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.

We store bundled thirdparty components and libraries in the ``thirdparty`` directory. Python
libraries are stored as wheels, eventually pre-built if the corresponding wheel is not available
in the Pypi repository. Some of these components may be advanced builds with bug fixes or advanced
patches.

We write tests, a lot of tests, thousands of tests. Several tests are data-driven and use data
files as test input and sometimes data files as test expectation (in this case using either
JSON or YAML files). The tests should pass on Linux 64 bits, Windows 32 and 64 bits and on
MacOSX 10.6.8 and up. We maintain two CI loops with Travis (Linux) at
https://travis-ci.org/nexB/scancode-toolkit and Appveyor (Windows) at
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nexB/scancode-toolkit.

When finding bugs or adding new features, we add tests. See existing test code for examples.

More info:

- Source code and license datasets are in the /src/ directory.
- Test code and test data are in the /tests/ directory.
- Datasets and test data are in /data/ sub-directories.
- Third-party components are vendored in the /thirdparty/ directory. ScanCode is self contained
  and should not require network access for installation or configuration of third-party libraries.
- Additional pre-compiled vendored binaries are stored in bin/ sub-directories of the /src/
  directory with their sources in this repo: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src/
- Porting ScanCode to other OS (FreeBSD, etc.) is possible. Enter an issue for help.
- Bugs and pull requests are welcomed.
- See the wiki and CONTRIBUTING.rst for more info.

Running tests
-------------

ScanCode comes with over 13,000 unit tests to ensure detection accuracy and stability across Linux,
Windows and macOS OSes: we kinda love tests, do we?

We use pytest to run the tests: call the ``py.test`` script to run the whole test suite. This is
installed by ``pytest``, which is bundled with a ScanCode checkout and installed when you
run ``./configure``).

If you are running from a fresh git clone and you run ``./configure`` and then
``source bin/activate`` the ``py.test`` command will be available in your path.

Alternatively, if you have already configured but are not in an activated "virtualenv" the
``py.test`` command is available under ``<root of your checkout>/bin/py.test``

(Note: paths here are for POSIX, but mostly the same applies to Windows)

If you have a multiprocessor machine you might want to run the tests in parallel (and faster)
For instance: ``py.test -n4`` runs the tests on 4 CPUs. We typically run the tests in
verbose mode with ``py.test -vvs -n4``.

You can also run a subset of the test suite as shown in the CI configs
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/appveyor.yml#L6 e,g,
``py.test -n 2 -vvs tests/scancode`` runs only the test scripts present in the ``tests/scancode``
directory. (You can pass a path to a specific test script file there too).

See also https://docs.pytest.org for details or use the ``py.test -h`` command to show the many
other options available.

One useful option is to run a select subset of the test functions matching a pattern with the
``-k`` option, for instance: ``py.test -vvs -k tcpdump`` would only run test functions that contain
the string "tcpdump" in their name or their class name or module name .

Another useful option after a test run with some failures is to re-run only the failed tests with
the ``--lf`` option, for instance: ``py.test -vvs --lf`` would only run only test functions that
failed in the previous run.

.. _contrib_dev_pip_and_configure:

pip requirements and the configure script
-----------------------------------------

ScanCode use the ``configure`` and ``configure.bat`` (and ``etc/configure.py`` behind the scenes)
scripts to install a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ , install required
packaged dependencies as `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_ requirements and more configure tasks
such that ScanCode can be installed in a self-contained way with no network connectivity required.

Earlier unreleased versions of ScanCode where using ``buildout`` to install and configure
eventually complex dependencies. We had some improvements that were merged in the upstream
``buildout`` to support bootstrapping and installing without a network connection and When we
migrated to use ``pip`` and ``wheels`` as new, improved and faster way to install and configure
dependencies we missed some of the features of ``buildout`` like the ``recipes``, being able to
invoke arbitrary Python or shell scripts after installing packages and have scripts or requirements
that are operating system-specific.

ScanCode requirements and third-party Python libraries
------------------------------------------------------

In a somewhat unconventional way, all the required libraries are bundled aka. Copied in the repo
itself in the thirdparty/ directory. If ScanCode were only a library it would not make sense. But
it is first an application and having a well defined frozen set of dependent packages is important
for an app. The benefit of this approach (combined with the ``configure`` script) means that a mere
checkout of the repository contains everything needed to run ScanCode except for a
Python interpreter.

Using ScanCode as a Python library
----------------------------------

ScanCode can be used alright as a Python library and is available as as a Python wheel in Pypi and
installed with ``pip install scancode-toolkit``.
