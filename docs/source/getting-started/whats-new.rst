Brief Summary Of Changes
------------------------

Documentation Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Scancode 3.1.1 Scancode comes with improved and comprehensive Documentation Support.

The documentation is available both offline (distributed with Scancode) and online,
at ``scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``. The documentation in GitHub wiki's will be
deprecated hereafter. The new documentation has improved support in terms of:

#. Consistent with the Latest Version
#. Command Line Interface Reference
#. Getting Started Support for Newcomers
#. Restructured to fit into the recommended `4 Category Doc Format <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`_
#. Updated Tutorials/How To's
#. Updated Plugin Support

This results in a much better documentation experience in Users and even contributors.

``pip install`` Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, ``pip install`` is the recommended install method, across all platforms. This greatly
simplifies the install process, and is much faster and easier than the Download and Configure
method, for non-developer users.

Python 3 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3 is now officially supported by Scancode-Toolkit.

This also means improved Unicode support, so it's easy to translate strings from Unicode to
other languages. And as Scancode has users in more than 100 languages, this is a major improvement.
