Brief Summary Of Changes
------------------------

Documentation Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Scancode 3.1.1 Scancode comes with improved and comprehensive Documentation Support.

The documentation is available both offline (distributed with Scancode) and online,
at ``scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``. The documentation in GitHub wiki's will be
deprecated hereafter. The new documentation has improved support in terms of:

#. Consistent with the Latest Version
#. Command Line Interface Reference
#. Getting Started Support for Newcomers
#. Restructured to fit into the recommended `4 Category Doc Format <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`_
#. Updated Tutorials/How To's
#. Updated Plugin Support

This results in a much better documentation experience in Users and even contributors.

Python 3 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3 is now officially supported by Scancode-Toolkit.

This also means improved Unicode support, so it's easy to translate strings from Unicode to
other languages. And as Scancode has users in more than 100 languages, this is a major improvement.

Better install Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, Downloading ScanCode as an Application is the recommended install method, across all platforms.
This greatly simplifies the install process, and is much easier for all users. Developers familiar with
package managers can also download ScanCode as a library, via ``pip`` or configure from the source. All
these methods are properly documented, across all platforms and scenarios.
