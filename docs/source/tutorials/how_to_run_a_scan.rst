How to Run a Scan
=================

In this simple tutorial example, we perform a basic scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed
by default with Scancode.

Prerequisites
-------------

Refer :ref:`install_prerequisites` to make sure the correct Python Interpreters and other
prerequisites are satisfied.

Setting up a Virtual Environment
--------------------------------

ScanCode Toolkit supports Python 3 in 3.2.x and later versions, so if you are using 3.2.x or later
versions, you should create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`_
using the ``Virtualenv`` tool with a python 3.6 interpreter.

The following commands set up and activate the Virtual Environment ``venv-scancode-py3``:

::

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.6 venv-scancode-py3
    source venv-scancode-py3/bin/activate


If you are using Scancode Toolkit 3.1.0 and earlier versions, they are not compatible with
Python 3.x so you should create the virtual environment with a python 2.7 interpreter::

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv-scancode-py2
    source venv-scancode-py2/bin/activate

Setting up Scancode Toolkit
---------------------------

Get ScanCode Toolkit from ``pip``::

    pip install scancode-toolkit

.. Note::

    You can install a specific version of Scancode Toolkit like ``scancode-toolkit==3.1.1``.

Looking into Files
------------------

As mentioned previously, we are going to perform the scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed
by default with Scancode Toolkit. Here's the directory structure and respective files:

.. image::  /scancode-toolkit/tutorials/data/files_sample.png

We notice here that the sample files contain a package ``zlib.tar.gz``. So we have to extract the
archive before running the scan, to also scan the files inside this package.

Performing Extraction
---------------------

To extract the packages inside ``samples`` directory::

    extractcode samples

This extracts the zlib.tar.gz package:

.. image::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/data/extractcode.png

.. note::

    ``--shallow`` option can be used to recursively extract packages.

Deciding Scan Options
---------------------

These are some common scan options you should consider using before you start the actual scan,
according to your requirements.

#. The Basic Scan options, i.e. ``-c``, ``-l``, ``-p``, ``-e``, ``-u``, and ``-i`` are to be
   decided, according to your requirements. If you do not need one specific type of information
   (say, licenses), consider removing it, because the more things you scan for, longer it will take
   for the scan to complete.

.. Note::

    You have to select these options explicitly, as they are not default anymore from
    versions 3.x, unlike earlier versions having ``-clp`` as default.

#. ``--license-score INTEGER`` is to be set if license matching accuracy is desired (Default is 0,
   and increasing this means a more accurate match). Also, using ``--license-text`` includes the
   matched text to the result.

#. ``-n INTEGER`` option can be used to speed up the scan using multiple parallel processes.

#. ``--timeout FLOAT`` option can be used to skip a file taking a lot of time to scan.

#. ``--ignore <pattern>`` can be used to skip certain group of files.

#. ``<OUTPUT FORMAT OPTION(s)>`` is also a very important decision when you want to use the output
   for specific tasks/have requirements. Here we are using ``json`` as ScanCode Workbench imports
   ``json`` files only.

For the complete list of options, refer :ref:`cli_list_options`.

Running The Scan
----------------

Now, run the scan with the options decided::

    scancode -clpeui -n 2 --ignore "*.java" --json-pp sample.json samples
