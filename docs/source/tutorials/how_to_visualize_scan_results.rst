How to Visualize Scan results
=============================

To help visualize the scans, we have a dedicated tool  `Scancode workbench <https://github.com/nexb/scancode-workbench/>`_  which is a desktop application that allows you to visualize and explore the results of one or more scans. It is a cross-platform application that runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is built using the Electron framework and is built using Electron, Typescript & React

Detailed Installation and Usage guide can be found here -  :ref:`scancode-workbench:getting-started`

.. WARNING::

    This tutorial uses the 32.x version of Scancode Toolkit, and Scancode Workbench 4.0.x (This version of ScanCode Workbench is compatible with scans from any ScanCode Toolkit develop
    version/branch at or after v32.x). If you are using an older version of Scancode Toolkit, check
    respective versions of this documentation. Also refer the Scancode Workbench
    `release highlights <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-workbench/releases/>`_.
