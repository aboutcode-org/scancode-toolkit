How To Extract Archives
=======================

ScanCode Toolkit provides archive extraction. This command can be used before running a scan over
a codebase in order to ensure all archives are extracted. Archives found inside an extracted
archive are extracted recursively. Extraction is done in-place in a directory and named after the
archive with ``'-extract'`` appended.
