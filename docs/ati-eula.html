  iii) transfer all your license rights in the Software  provided  you  must
   also transfer a copy of this License, the backup copy  of  the  Software,
   the ATI Hardware and the related documentation  and  provided  the  other
   party reads and agrees  to  accept  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this
   License.  Upon such transfer your license rights are then terminated.

(d)   In addition to the license terms above, with respect  to  portions  of
the Software in source code or binary  form  designed  exclusively  for  use
with the Linux operating system (&#34;ATI Linux Code&#34;), you  may  use,  display,

   herein to ATI or any  other  third  party  without  further  restriction,
   royalty or any other license requirement;

   vi) to  the  extent  there  is  any ATI sample or  control  panel  source

   code except for portions thereof that  may  be  subject  to  third  party
   license terms that grant such rights; and

   vii) ATI is not obligated to provide any maintenance or technical support
   for any code resulting from ATI Linux Code.

provisions, the minimum rights shall prevail.

5.  No Other License.  No rights or licenses are granted by ATI  under  this
License, expressly or  by  implication,  with  respect  to  any  proprietary

RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS  ASSUMED  BY  YOU.   FURTHERMORE,
ATI DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS  REGARDING  THE  USE  ORTHE

THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY,  RELIABILITY,  CURRENTNESS,  OR  OTHERWISE.  NO
ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE  GIVEN  BY  ATI  OR  ATI&#39;S  AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE  SCOPE  OF
THIS WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU  (AND  NOT  ATI  OR
ATI&#39;S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE  COST  OF  ALL  NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THE SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED  FOR  USE  IN
MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR LIFE SUSTAINING  APPLICATIONS.   SOME  JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,  SO  THE  ABOVE  EXCLUSION

party claim.   In no event shall  ATI&#39;s  total  liability  to  you  for  all
damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort  (including
negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you  for  the  Software.
The foregoing limitations will apply even if  the  above  stated  limitation
fails of its essential purpose.

9.  Controlling Law and Severability.  This License  shall  be  governed  by
and construed under the laws of the  Province  of  Ontario,  Canada  without
reference to its conflict of law principles.   Any  dispute  related  hereto
will be brought only in the courts in  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada  and  such
courts are agreed  to  be  the  convenient  forum.   In  the  event  of  any
conflicts between foreign law, rules, and  regulations,  and  Canadian  law,
rules, and regulations, Canadian law, rules and  regulations  shall  prevail
and  govern.   The  United  Nations  Convention   on   Contracts   for   the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this  License.   If  for  any
reason a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  finds  any  provision  of  this
License or portion thereof, to  be  unenforceable,  that  provision  of  the
License shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to  effect
the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License shall  continue
in full force and effect.

10.  Complete Agreement.  This  License  constitutes  the  entire  agreement
between the parties with respect to the use of the Software and the  related
documentation, and supersedes all prior  or  contemporaneous  understandings
