THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IN ANY EVENT, ADOBE&#39;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO TEN U.S. DOLLARS. Nothing contained in this agreement limits Adobe&#39;s or its suppliers’ liability to you in the event of death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud).

10. Export Rules. You agree that the SDK Components will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions or regulations (collectively the &#34;Export Laws&#34;). In addition, if the SDK Components are identified as an export controlled item under the Export Laws, you represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of, or located within, an embargoed or otherwise restricted nation (including Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba and North Korea) and that you are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the SDK Components.	All rights to use the
SDK Components are granted on condition that such rights are forfeited if you fail to comply with the terms of this agreement.
