For the purposes of this Agreement: &#34;Independent Implementation&#34; shall mean an implementation of the Specification that neither derives from any of Sun&#39;s source code or binary code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Sun, includes any of Sun&#39;s source code or binary code materials; and &#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;, &#34;javax&#34;, &#34;com.sun&#34; or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Sun through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply with any material provision of or act outside the scope of the licenses granted above.
