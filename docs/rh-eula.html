RED HAT® ENTERPRISE LINUX® AND RED HAT APPLICATIONS

This end user license agreement (&#34;EULA&#34;) governs the use of any of the versions
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any Red Hat Applications (as set forth at
www.redhat.com/licenses/products), and any related updates, source code,
appearance, structure and organization (the &#34;Programs&#34;), regardless of the
delivery mechanism.


1.  License Grant.  Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. (&#34;Red Hat&#34;)
    grants to you (&#34;User&#34;) a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs
    pursuant to the GNU General Public License v.2.  The Programs are either a
    modular operating system or an application consisting of hundreds of
    software components.  With the exception of certain image files identified
    in Section 2 below, the license agreement for each software component is
    located in the software component&#39;s source code and permits User to run,
    copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some
    cases) the software component, in both source code and binary code forms.
    This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not limit User&#39;s rights
    under, or grant User rights that supersede, the license terms of any
    particular component.

2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Programs and each of their components are
    owned by Red Hat and others and are protected under copyright law and under
    other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs and any component, or to any
    copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with the aforementioned,
    subject to the applicable license.  The &#34;Red Hat&#34; trademark and the
    &#34;Shadowman&#34; logo are registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other
    countries.  This EULA does not permit User to distribute the Programs or
    their components using Red Hat&#39;s trademarks, regardless of whether the copy
    has been modified.  User should read the information found at
    http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a copy
    of the Programs.  User may make a commercial redistribution of the Programs
    only if, (a) a separate agreement with Red Hat authorizing such commercial
    redistribution is executed or other written permission is granted by Red Hat
    or (b) User modifies any files identified as &#34;REDHAT-LOGOS&#34; to remove and
    replace all images containing the &#34;Red Hat&#34; trademark or the &#34;Shadowman&#34;
    logo.  Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Programs.

3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a
    separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular component, to
    the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and the
    components are provided and licensed &#34;as is&#34; without warranty of any kind,
    expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability,
    non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.  Red Hat warrants that
    the media on which the Programs and the components are furnished will be
    free from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period
    of 30 days from the date of delivery to User.  Red Hat does not warrant that
    the functions contained in the Programs will meet User&#39;s requirements or
    that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear
    precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with
    regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party that
    purchases services pertaining to the Programs from Red Hat or a Red Hat
    authorized distributor.

4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by
    applicable law, User&#39;s exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any
    defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of User&#39;s
    payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the
    money paid by User for the media.  To the maximum extent permitted under
    applicable law, neither Red Hat, any Red Hat authorized distributor, nor the
    licensor of any component provided to User under this EULA will be liable to
    User for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or
    lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any
    component, even if Red Hat, such authorized distributor or licensor has been
    advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event shall Red Hat&#39;s
    liability, an authorized distributor’s liability or the liability of the
    licensor of a component provided to User under this EULA exceed the amount
    that User paid to Red Hat under this EULA during the twelve months preceding
    the action.

5.  Export Control.  As required by the laws of the United States and other
    countries, User represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that the
    Programs and their components may be subject to export controls under the
    U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations (&#34;EAR&#34;); (b) is
    not located in a prohibited destination country under the EAR or
    U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan
    and Syria, subject to change as posted by the United States government); (c)
    will not export, re-export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited
    destination or persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and
    Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign
    Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons,
    or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the necessary
    export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer the
    Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological
    weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an
    applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government agency
    by regulation or specific license; (e) understands and agrees that if it is
    in the United States and exports or transfers the Programs to eligible end
    users, it will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit
    semi-annual reports to the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and
    Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each
    transferee; and (f) understands that countries including the United States
    may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products (which may
    include the Programs and the components) and agrees that it shall be solely
    responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export
    restrictions.

6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs
    with the Programs that are not part of the Programs.  These third party
    programs are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience
    to User, and are subject to their own license terms.  The license terms
    either accompany the third party software programs or can be viewed at
    http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html.  If User does not agree
    to abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software
    programs, then User may not install them.  If User wishes to install the
    third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the third
    party software programs to another party, then User must contact the
    licensor of the applicable third party software programs.

7.  General.  In the case of a discrepancy between the Spanish version and the
    English version of this EULA, the English version shall prevail. If any
    provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not
    affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions.  This agreement shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States,
    without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and
    obligations of the parties to this EULA shall not be governed by the United
    Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
