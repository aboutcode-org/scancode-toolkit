Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver&#39;s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be a Beta Tester that is under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (&#34;COPPA&#34;), the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or &#34;GDPR&#34;), and all other relevant laws and regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy: (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users&#39; activity and otherwise collect information from users. For Developer&#39;s users in the European Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users&#39; consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their information in the United States and any other country where Crashlytics, or any third party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where such users live. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including without limitation, COPPA, GDPR, and all other such laws and regulations. Developer will obtain and maintain any required consents necessary and will comply with any other applicable requirements to permit the processing of Developer Data under this Agreement.

2.7 Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing: (a) all equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services at its facility (collectively, &#34;Developer Systems&#34;). Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

2.8 Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other problems which are related to: (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics&#39;s facilities or control.

2.9 Confidentiality. &#34;Confidential Information&#34; means any information disclosed by one party (&#34;Discloser&#34;) to the other party (&#34;Recipient&#34;) that is marked or otherwise identified as &#34;confidential&#34; or &#34;proprietary,&#34; or by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure should reasonably be understood to be confidential, including without limitation, all financial, business or technical information disclosed in relation to this Agreement. Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, the Recipient may not use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the Discloser without Discloser&#39;s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser&#39;s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient&#39;s employees, contractors and agents (&#34;Representatives&#34;)with access to Discloser&#39;s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Recipient can demonstrate is: (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c) generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently developed by it without reference to or use of any of Discloser&#39;s Confidential Information and without any violation of any obligation of this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser&#39;s request at any time, Recipient shall, or in the case of Developer Data shall use reasonable efforts to, return all of Discloser&#39;s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other&#39;s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose where permitted by law, and (ii) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

4.3 Claims Against Crashlytics. Developer will defend Crashlytics from all third party claims, whether actual or alleged (collectively, &#34;Crashlytics Claims&#34;), and will indemnify Crashlytics and hold Crashlytics harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#39;s fees) resulting from such Crashlytics Claims that arise out of Developer&#39;s: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject to Crashlytics&#39;s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, resulting from such Claims against Crashlytics, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics&#39;s prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from any obligation or liability. If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent required by applicable law.

4.4 Claims Against Developer. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, &#34;Developer Claims&#34;), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#39;s fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself. This Section 4.4 states Crashlytics&#39;s entire liability and Developer&#39;s sole and exclusive remedy for all third party claims.

4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at the other party&#39;s request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party&#39;s prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.

4.6 Limitation of Liability.

(a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.

(b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY&#39;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).

The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

6.4 Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

(b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section 6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA&#39;S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES.The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement (&#34;Rules&#34;). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party&#39;s rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator&#39;s powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.

The parties will pay the arbitrator&#39;s fees, the arbitrator&#39;s appointed experts&#39; fees and expenses, and the arbitration center&#39;s administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party&#39;s obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers&#39; and experts&#39; fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator&#39;s final decision.

6.5 Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, the affected party shall give written notice thereof to the other party and its performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.
