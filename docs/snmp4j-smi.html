============================

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (this &#34;Agreement&#34;) is  made effective as of the date  the
product is  installed by and between (i) Frank Fock,  the  author  of SNMP4J-SMI
(&#34;LICENSOR&#34;) and the party executing this Agreement as Licensee (&#34;LICENSEE&#34;).


1. DEFINITIONS.

1.1  The  term   &#34;Software Product&#34;  means   Frank  Fock&#39;s  SNMP4J-SMI  computer
software (including  Source Code,  derived Object  Code, and  derived Executable
Code  as defined  in Section 1.3,  1.4, and 1.5)  and documentation thereof,  as
specified in Exhibit A,  that is  provided by  LICENSOR to  LICENSEE  hereunder,
including bug fixes and updates   thereto provided by  LICENSOR to  LICENSEE  in
connection with this Agreement. The  term &#34;derived&#34; in the above  context refers
to the process  of creating machine  executable  code from   the original Source
Code only.   It  does  not refer   to amendment  or alteration   of the original
Source Code by LICENSOR or any third party.

1.2  The  term &#34;Intellectual  Property  Rights&#34; means  patent  rights, copyright
rights, trade secret rights, and any other intellectual property rights.

1.3 The  term &#34;Executable  Code&#34; is  a fully  compiled and  linked program  that
contains any code derived from the Software Product. It can no longer be altered
or combined with any  other code. Executable code  is ready to be  executed by a
computer and  is essentially  a complete  software image  for use  in a specific
product.

1.4 The term &#34;Object Code&#34; is the compiled version of the Software Product  that
can be linked and therefore combined with other code to create  Executable  Code
as specified in Exhibit A. Examples of Object Code  are libraries  and  software
development kits, in particular SNMP development kits.

1.5 The term &#34;Source Code&#34; is  the human readable form of the  Software Product,
as specified in Exhibit A.

1.6  Documentation  means  the  documentation  regarding  the  Licensed Software
provided by LICENSOR to LICENSEE hereunder.


2. GRANT OF LICENSE.

2.1 Source and Object Code User License. Subject to the terms and  conditions of
this Agreement, and upon payment by LICENSEE to LICENSOR of the one-time license
fee set forth in Addendum A,  LICENSOR grants  LICENSEE a  perpetual (subject to
termination rights  in Section  6), non-exclusive,  non-transferable license  to
reproduce, and use the Object Code for LICENSEE&#39;s personal use only.

2.2 Except as  specified in 2.1,  neither the Software  Product Source Code  nor
Object Code derived  from the Software  Product may be  redistributed or resold.
Executable Code programs derived from the Software Product may be  redistributed
and  resold  without limitation  and   without royalty,  provided  that LICENSEE
added  significant functionality  to those  derived  Excecutable  Code programs.
Functionality in this context refers to the program&#39;s behavior, not appearance.

2.3  No Sublicense  Right.  LICENSEE  has no  right to  transfer, or  sublicense
the Licensed Software  to  any third   party, except  as  specified in 2.2   and
except if the third party takes over the business of LICENSEE.

2.4  Other Restrictions  in License  Grants.  LICENSEE  may not:  (i) copy   the
Licensed  Software,  except  as  necessary  to  use  the  Licensed  Software  in

except for a reasonable number of backup copies. (ii) LICENSEE acknowledges that
Licensed  Software  is  not  designed  or  intended  for  use  in  the   design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.

compatibility of  the Software  Product with  any third-party  products, whether
hardware or software.

alterations of the Software Product made by LICENSEE.

under normal   use; and  (iii) not  in  combination  with other  items; provided
that  LICENSOR is  promptly notified in   writing of  any  such  suit or   claim
against   LICENSEE  and   further provided  that  LICENSEE  permits LICENSOR  to
defend,  compromise or  settle the  same and   gives  LICENSOR   all   available
information,  reasonable  assistance    and authority to  enable LICENSOR to  do
so. LICENSOR&#39;S LIABILITY TO LICENSEE PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE IS LIMITED TO  THE

reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized persons shall have access to the
