Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the foregoing copyright license.

3. 	Grant of Patent License. 	Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Software to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software or a Contribution incorporated within the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

4. 	Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Software or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object Format, provided that You meet the following conditions: 

     (a) 	You must give any other recipients of the Software or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) 	You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

(c) 	You must retain, in the Source Format of any Derivative Works that You distribute, BEA&#39;s copyright notice, © [Date] BEA Systems, Inc.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Software otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. 	Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Software by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. 	Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. 	Disclaimer of Warranty.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Software and assume all risks associated with Your exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

9. 	Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Software, if You include the Software in a commercial product offering, You may do so only in a manner which does not create potential liability for any Contributor. Therefore, if You include the Software in a commercial product offering, You shall and hereby do agree to defend and indemnify each and every Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &#34;Losses&#34;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against such Contributor(s) to the extent caused by Your acts or omissions in connection with Your distribution of the Software in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify to receive indemnification from You, a Contributor must: a) promptly notify You in writing of such claim, and b) allow the You to control, and cooperate with the You in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Contributor indemnified by You may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</code></pre>
