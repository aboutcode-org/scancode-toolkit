Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement\nthat details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by\nyourself to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications\nyou may have made) should the recipient request it.\n2. The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related\nproduct.\n3. The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to\nFreeRTOS and do not merely extend the existing functionality already\npresent in FreeRTOS.\nClause 2\nFreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose,\nincluding the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric,\nwithout the express permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd.
