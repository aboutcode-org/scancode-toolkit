Last modified: May 1, 2018

This Google Maps Platform License Agreement takes effect on June 11, 2018.  

If you are currently using the Google Maps Standard Plan, this Google Maps Platform License Agreement will govern your use of the Google Maps Platform as of June 11, 2018.   The current Google Maps Platform Terms of Service, which govern your use of the Google Maps Platform until June 11, 2018,  is available at https://developers.google.com/maps/terms.

Google Maps Platform License Agreement

This Google Maps Platform License Agreement (the &#34;Agreement&#34;) is made and entered into between Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms (&#34;Customer&#34;). &#34;Google&#34; means either (i) Google Commerce Limited (“GCL”), a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if Customer has a billing address in the EU and has chosen “non-business” as the tax status/setting for its Google account, (ii) Google Ireland Limited, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if Customer&#39;s billing address is in any country within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa (&#34;EMEA&#34;), (iii) Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., with offices at 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City II Singapore 117371, if Customer&#39;s billing address is in any country within the Asia Pacific region (&#34;APAC&#34;) except as provided below for Customers with the billing address in Japan or Australia, (iv) Google Cloud Japan G.K., with offices at Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, 10-1, Roppongi 6-chome, Minato-ku Tokyo, if Customer’s billing address is in Japan, (v) Google Australia Pty Ltd., with offices at Level 5, 48 Pirrama Road, Pyrmont, NSW 2009 Australia, if Customer’s billing address is in Australia, or (vi) Google LLC, with offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, if Customer&#39;s billing address is in any country in the world other than those in EMEA and APAC.

This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement (the &#34;Effective Date&#34;). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs Customer&#39;s access to and use of the Services.

For an offline variant of this Agreement, you may contact Google for more information.
1. Provision of the Services.

1.1 Use of the Services in Customer Applications.  Google will provide the Services to Customer in accordance with the applicable SLA, and Customer may use the Google Maps Core Services in Customer Application(s) in accordance with Section 3 (License).

1.2 Admin Console; Projects; API Keys. Customer will administer the Services through the online Admin Console. To access the Services, Customer must create Project(s) and use its API key(s) in accordance with the Documentation.

1.3 Accounts.  Customer must have an Account to use the Services. Customer is responsible for the information it provides in connection with the Account, its passwords, and use of its Account.

1.4 New Features and Services. Google may: (a) make new features or functionality available through the Services and (b) add new services to the &#34;Services&#34; definition (by adding them at the URL stated under that definition). Customer’s use of new features or functionality may be contingent on Customer’s agreement to additional terms applicable to the new feature or functionality.

1.5 Modifications.

1.5.1 To the Services. Google may make changes to the Services, subject to Section 9 (Deprecation Policy), which may include adding, updating, or discontinuing any Services or portion or feature(s) of the Services. Google will notify Customer of any material change to the Services.

1.5.2. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked documents). Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by: (a) sending an email to Customer’s primary point of contact; (b) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (c) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer should stop using the Services. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.
2. Payment Terms.

2.1 Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.

2.2 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (a) Customer’s use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period; (b) any Committed Purchases selected; and (c) any Package Purchases selected. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customer’s obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google&#39;s measurement of Customer’s use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google. If Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google may collect payments via Google Payment Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.

2.3 Taxes.

2.3.1 Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject to local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up) by the Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer and Customer will ensure that Google will receives payment for its services for the net amount as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax authority).

2.3.2 If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Google with applicable tax identification information that Google may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer.

2.4 Invoice Disputes &amp; Refunds. Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Google and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.

2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, Google may suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach under Section 11.2 (Termination for Breach).

2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. Google is not required to provide a purchase order number on Google’s invoice (or otherwise).
3. License.

3.1 License Grant. Subject to this Agreement&#39;s terms, during the Term, Google grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use the Services in Customer Application(s), which may be: (a) fee-based or non-fee-based; (b) public/external or private/internal; (c) business-to-business or business-to-consumer; or (d) asset tracking.

3.2 License Requirements and Restrictions. The following are conditions of the license granted in Section 3.1.  In this Section 3.2, the phrase “Customer will not” means “Customer will not, and will not permit a third party to”.

3.2.2 General Restrictions. Unless Google specifically agrees in writing, Customer will not: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) sublicense, transfer, or distribute any of the Services; (c) sell, resell, or otherwise make the Services available as a commercial offering to a third party; or (d) access or use the Services: (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; (iii) for activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (iv) on behalf of or for the benefit of any entity or person who is legally prohibited from using the Services; or (v) to transmit, store, or process Protected Health Information (as defined in and subject to HIPAA).

3.2.3 Requirements for Using the Services.

(a) End User Terms and Privacy Policy. Customer’s End User terms of service will state that End Users’ use of Google Maps is subject to the then-current Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html and Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

(b) Attribution.  Customer will display all attribution that (i) Google provides through the Services (including branding, logos, and copyright and trademark notices); or (ii) is specified in the Service Specific Terms. Customer will not modify, obscure, or delete such attribution.

(c) Review of Customer Applications. At Google’s request, Customer will submit Customer Application(s) and Project(s) to Google for review to ensure compliance with the Agreement (including the AUP).

3.2.4 Restrictions Against Misusing the Services.

(a)  No Scraping.  Customer will not extract, export, or scrape Google Maps Content for use outside the Services. For example, Customer will not:(i) pre-fetch, cache, index, or store Google Maps Content for more than 30 days; (ii) bulk download geocodes; or (iii) copy business names, addresses, or user reviews.

(b) No Creating Content From Google Maps Content. Customer will not create content based on Google Maps Content, including tracing, digitizing, or creating other datasets based on Google Maps Content.

(c) No Re-Creating Google Products or Features. Customer will not use the Services to create a product or service with features that are substantially similar to or that re-create the features of another Google product or service. Customer’s product or service must contain substantial, independent value and features beyond the Google products or services.  For example, Customer will not: (i) re-distribute the Google Maps Core Services or pass them off as if they were Customer’s services; (ii) create a substitute of the Google Maps Core Services, Google Maps, or Google Maps mobile apps, or their features; (iii) use the Google Maps Core Services in a listings or directory service or to create or augment an advertising product; (iv) combine data from the Directions API, Geolocation API, and Maps SDK for Android to create real-time navigation functionality substantially similar to the functionality provided by the Google Maps for Android mobile app.

(d) No Use With Non-Google Maps. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in a Customer Application that contains a non-Google map. For example, Customer will not (i) display Places listings on a non-Google map, or (ii) display Street View imagery and non-Google maps in the same Customer Application.

(e) No Circumventing Fees.  Customer will not circumvent the applicable Fees. For example, Customer will not create multiple billing accounts or Projects to avoid incurring Fees; prevent Google from accurately calculating Customer’s Service usage levels; abuse any free Service quotas; or offer access to the Services under a “time-sharing” or “service bureau” model.

(f) No Use in Prohibited Territories. Customer will not distribute or market in a Prohibited Territory any Customer Application(s) that use the Google Maps Core Services.

(g) No Use in Embedded Vehicle Systems. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in connection with any Customer Application or device embedded in a vehicle. For example, Customer will not create a Customer Application that (i) is embedded in an in-dashboard automotive infotainment system; and (ii) allows End Users to request driving directions from the Directions API.

(h) No Modifying Search Results Integrity. Customer will not modify any of the Service’s search results.

(i) No Use for High Risk Activities. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services for High Risk Activities.

3.2.5 Benchmarking. Customer may not publicly disclose directly or through a third party the results of any comparative or compatibility testing, benchmarking, or evaluation of the Services (each, a “Test”), unless the disclosure includes all information necessary for Google or a third party to replicate the Test. If Customer conducts, or directs a third party to conduct, a Test of the Services and publicly discloses the results directly or through a third party, then Google (or a Google directed third party) may conduct Tests of any publicly available cloud products or services provided by Customer and publicly disclose the results of any such Test (which disclosure will include all information necessary for Customer or a third party to replicate the Test).
4. Customer Obligations. 

4.1 Customer Domains and Applications. Customer must list in the Admin Console each authorized domain and application that uses the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring that only authorized domains and applications use the Services.

4.2 Compliance. Customer will: (a) ensure that Customer’s and its End Users’ use of the Services complies with the Agreement, including the applicable Services’ AUP and URL Terms; and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent, promptly notify Google of, and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to its Account(s) or the Services.

4.3 Documentation. Google may provide Documentation for Customer’s use of the Services. The Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on how the Services may be used and Customer will comply with any such restrictions specified.

4.4 Copyright Policy. Google provides information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but Google cannot determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to applicable copyright laws including in particular the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer thinks somebody is violating Customer’s or Customer End Users’ copyrights and wants to notify Google, Customer can find information about submitting notices, and Google&#39;s policy about responding to notices at https://www.google.com/dmca.html.

4.5 Data Use, Protection, and Privacy.

4.5.1 Data Use and Retention. To provide the Services through the Customer Application(s), Google must receive and collect data from End Users and Customer, including search terms, IP addresses, and latitude/longitude coordinates.

4.5.2 European Data Protection Terms. Google and Customer agree to the Google Maps Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms at https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/maps-controller-terms.

4.5.3 General Privacy Requirements.

(a) End User Privacy.  Customer’s use of the Services in the Customer Application will comply with applicable privacy laws, including laws regarding Services that store and access Cookies on End Users’ devices.  If Customer has End Users in the European Economic Area, Customer will comply with the EU End User Consent Policy at https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html.

(b) End User Personal Data. Through the normal functioning of the Google Maps Core Services, End Users provide device identifiers and Personal Data directly to Google, subject to the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
