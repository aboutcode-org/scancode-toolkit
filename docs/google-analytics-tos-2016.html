These Google Analytics Terms of Service (this &#34;Agreement&#34;) are entered into by Google Inc. (&#34;Google&#34;) and the entity executing this Agreement (&#34;You&#34;). This Agreement governs Your use of the standard Google Analytics (the &#34;Service&#34;). BY CLICKING THE &#34;I ACCEPT&#34; BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF, AND BIND TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT. In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions.
&#34;Account&#34; refers to the billing account for the Service. All Profiles linked to a single Property will have their Hits aggregated before determining the charge for the Service for that Property.

&#34;Confidential Information&#34; includes any proprietary data and any other information disclosed by one party to the other in writing and marked &#34;confidential&#34; or disclosed orally and, within five business days, reduced to writing and marked &#34;confidential&#34;. However, Confidential Information will not include any information that is or becomes known to the general public, which is already in the receiving party&#39;s possession prior to disclosure by a party or which is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of Confidential Information.

&#34;Customer Data&#34; or “Google Analytics Data&#34; means the data you collect, process or store using the Service concerning the characteristics and activities of Visitors.

&#34;Documentation&#34; means any accompanying documentation made available to You by Google for use with the Processing Software, including any documentation available online.

&#34;GATC&#34; means the Google Analytics Tracking Code, which is installed on a Property for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes, updates and upgrades provided to You.

&#34;Hit&#34; means the base unit that the Google Analytics system processes. A Hit may be a call to the Google Analytics system by various libraries, including, Javascript (e.g., analytics.js), Silverlight, Flash, and Mobile. A Hit may currently be a page view, a transaction, item, or event, social interaction, or user timing. Hits may also be delivered to the Google Analytics system without using one of the various libraries by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms the Service makes available to You.

&#34;Processing Software&#34; means the Google Analytics server-side software and any upgrades, which analyzes the Customer Data and generates the Reports.

&#34;Profile&#34; means the collection of settings that together determine the information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For example, a Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as a unique Report. There can be multiple Profiles established under a single Property.

&#34;Property&#34; means any web page, app, or other property under Your control that sends data to Google Analytics. Each Property includes a default Profile that measures all pages within the Property.

&#34;Privacy Policy&#34; means the privacy policy on a Property.

&#34;Report&#34; means the resulting analysis shown at www.google.com/analytics/ for a Profile.

&#34;Servers&#34; means the servers controlled by Google (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) on which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.

&#34;Software&#34; means the GATC and the Processing Software.

&#34;Third Party&#34; means any third party (i) to which You provide access to Your Account or (ii) for which You use the Service to collect information on the third party&#39;s behalf.

&#34;Visitors&#34; means visitors to Your Properties.

The words &#34;include&#34; and &#34;including&#34; mean &#34;including but not limited to.&#34;

2. Fees and Service.

The changes to the fees or payment policies are effective upon Your acceptance of those changes which will be posted at www.google.com/analytics/. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of this Agreement and any collection expenses (including attorneys&#39; fees) incurred by Google will be included in the amount owed, and may be charged to the credit card or other billing mechanism associated with Your AdWords account.

When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process Customer Data only on Google&#39;s instructions and in compliance with this Agreement and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

7. Privacy.
You will not and will not assist or permit any third party to, pass information to Google that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information.

This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data when you use our partners&#39; sites or apps”, (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a Visitor is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the Visitor’s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.

You must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g., an opt-out) that are part of the Service.

8. Indemnification.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You will indemnify, hold harmless and defend Google and its wholly owned subsidiaries, at Your expense, from any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against Google or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by Google or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to (i) Your breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, (ii) Your use of the Service, (iii) Your violations of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Service, (iv) any representations and warranties made by You concerning any aspect of the Service, the Software or Reports to any Third Party; (v) any claims made by or on behalf of any Third Party pertaining directly or indirectly to Your use of the Service, the Software or Reports; (vi) violations of Your obligations of privacy to any Third Party; and (vii) any claims with respect to acts or omissions of any Third Party in connection with the Service, the Software or Reports.

15. Modifications to Terms of Service and Other Policies.
Google may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Service. You should look at the terms regularly. Google will post notice of modifications to these terms at www.google.com/analytics/, the Google Analytics Policies at www.google.com/analytics/policies/, or other policies referenced in these terms at the applicable URL for such policies. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 14 days after they are posted. If You do not agree to the modified terms for the Service, You should discontinue Your use Google Analytics. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement will be binding unless (i) in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Google, (ii) You accept updated terms online, or (iii) You continue to use the Service after Google has posted updates to the Agreement or to any policy governing the Service.

16. Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.
Google will be excused from performance in this Agreement to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control. This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing) represents the complete agreement between You and Google concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement. The Software is controlled by U.S. Export Regulations, and it may be not be exported to or used by embargoed countries or individuals. Any notices to Google must be sent to: Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to Legal Department, via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights in this Agreement without Google&#39;s prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between Google and You is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections of this Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two sentences), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16.
