## Introduction

### 🤔 What you will have to Do

You'll have to contribute to the ScanCode Toolkit Documentation, to solve inconsistensies/update
docs.

 - You'll find an issue from [here](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/1826)
 - Create an issue using this template [here]() 
 - And then solve it (Follow the Task List Below).

### A first-timer's Issue

Hi, this is a [first-timers-only issue](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/labels/%20first%20timers%20only).
This means we've worked to make it more legible to folks who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before,
or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**. 

If that's you, we're interested in helping you take the first step and can answer questions and
help you out as you do. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from people from
groups underrepresented in free and open source software!

We know that the process of creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors and
this issue is for you. 💝

If you have contributed before, **consider leaving this one for someone new**, and looking through
our general [good first issue](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/labels/good%20first%20issue) issues. Thanks!

### 🤔 What you will need to know.

Nothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :)
You need to learn basic reStructuredText formatting, and very basic linux/git commands. 
We are happy to walk you through the process.

Useful Links - 

* [reStructuredText basics](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
* [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

Remember, basic help is just one Google Search away!

### Please keep us updated

💬⏰ - We encourage contributors to be respectful to the community and provide an update
**within a week** of claiming a first-timers-only issue. We're happy to keep it assigned to you as
long as you need if you update us with a request for more time or help, but if we don't see any
activity a week after you claim it we may reassign it to give someone else a chance.
Thank you in advance! 

If this happens to you, don't sweat it! Grab another open issue.

### Is someone else already working on this?

🔗- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can
easily see if someone's already started on it. 

👥- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!** Otherwise,
[take a look at some other issues you can help with](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/labels/%20first%20timers%20only).
Thanks!
