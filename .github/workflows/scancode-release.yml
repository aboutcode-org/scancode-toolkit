name: Create ScanCode release archives, then test and publish to GH and PyPI

 # This is executed automatically on a tag
 #
 # Summary of the steps:
 # - Build wheel and sdist for the "main" scancode, then build these for the "mini" flavor
 #  - test each wheel and sdist on every possible OS x Python version combinations
 # - Build release app archives, one for each of linux, windows, macos on Python 3.8
 #  - test each on its target OS and Python version
 # - Create gh-release and upload app archives to release
 # - Upload all wheels and sdist to PyPI
