ScanCode toolkit
================

A typical software project often reuses hundreds of third-party packages.
License and origin information is not always easy to find and not normalized:
ScanCode discovers and normalizes this data for you.

Read more about ScanCode here: `scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Why use ScanCode?
=================

- As a **standalone command line tool**, ScanCode is **easy to install**, run
  and embed in your CI/CD processing pipeline. It runs on **Windows, macOS and Linux**.

- ScanCode is **used by several projects and organizations** such as the `Eclipse
  Foundation <https://www.eclipse.org>`_, `OpenEmbedded.org <https://www.openembedded.org>`_,
  the `FSF <https://www.fsf.org>`_, `OSS Review Toolkit <http://oss-review-toolkit.org>`_, 
  `ClearlyDefined.io <https://clearlydefined.io/>`_,
  `RedHat Fabric8 analytics <https://github.com/fabric8-analytics>`_ and many more.

- ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, package manifests and direct dependencies
  and more both in **source code** and **binary** files.

- ScanCode provides the **most accurate license detection engine** and does a
  full comparison (aka. diff or red line) between a database of license texts
  and your code instead of relying only on regex patterns or probabilistic
  search, edit distance or machine learning.

- Written in Python, ScanCode is **easy to extend with plugins** to contribute new
  and improved scanners, data summarization, package manifest parsers and new
  outputs.

- You can save your scan results as **JSON, HTML, CSV or SPDX**. And you can use the
  companion `ScanCode workbench GUI app <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_
  to review and display scan results, statistics and graphics.

- ScanCode is **actively maintained**, has a **growing community of users**.

- ScanCode is heavily **tested** with an automated test suite of over **8000 tests**.

Quick Start
===========

Install Python 2.7 then download and extract the latest ScanCode release from
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/ 

Then run ``./scancode -h`` for help.


Installation
============

Pre-requisites:

* On Windows, please follow the `Comprehensive Installation instructions
  <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation>`_.
  Make sure you use Python 2.7 32 bits from
  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15.msi

* On macOS, install Python 2.7 from
  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15-macosx10.6.pkg

  Next, download and extract the latest ScanCode release from
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/

* On Linux install the Python 2.7 "devel" and these packages using your
  distribution package manager:

  * On Ubuntu 14, 16 and 18 use:
    ``sudo apt-get install python-dev xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev bzip2``

  * On Debian and Debian-based distros use:
    ``sudo apt-get install python-dev xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libbz2-1.0``

  * On RPM distros use:
    ``sudo yum install python-devel xz-libs zlib libxml2-devel libxslt-devel bzip2-libs``

  * On Fedora 22 and later use:
    ``sudo dnf install python-devel xz-libs zlib libxml2-devel libxslt-devel bzip2-libs``

* See also the `Comprehensive Installation instructions 
  <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation>`_
  for additional instructions.


Next, download and extract the latest ScanCode release from
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/


Open a terminal window and then `cd` to the extracted ScanCode directory and run
this command to display help. ScanCode will self-configure if needed::

    ./scancode --help

You can run an example scan printed on screen as JSON::

    ./scancode -clip --json-pp - samples

See more command examples::

    ./scancode --examples


Archive extraction
==================

The archives that exist in a codebase must be extracted before running a scan:
ScanCode does not extract files from tarballs, zip files, etc. as part of the
scan. The bundled utility `extractcode` is a mostly-universal archive extractor.
For example, this command will recursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in
the mytar.tar.bz2-extract directory::

    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2
