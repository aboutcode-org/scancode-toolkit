v2.9.0b1 (2018-03-02)
---------------------

This is a major pre-release of what will come up for 3.0

that are not yet fully documented but it can be used for testing.

API changes:
 * Command line API

  * `--diag` option renamed to `--license-diag`

  * `--format <format code>` option has been replaced by multiple options one
    for each format such as `--format-csv` `--format-json` and multiple formats
    can be requested at once

  * new experimental `--cache-dir` option and `SCANCODE_CACHE` environment variable
    and `--temp-dir` and `SCANCODE_TMP` environment variable to set the temp and
    cache directories.

 * JSON data output format: no major changes

 * programmatic API in scancode/api.py:

  * get_urls(location, threshold=50): new threshold argument

  * get_emails(location, threshold=50): new threshold argument

  * get_file_infos renamed to get_file_info

  * Resource moved to scancode.resource and significantly updated

  * get_package_infos renamed to get_package_info


Command line
 * You can select multiple outputs at once (e.g. JSON and CSV, etc.) #789
 * There is a new capability to reload a JSON scan to reprocess it with postcsan
   plugins and or converting a JSON scan to CSV or else.


Licenses:
 * There are several new and improved licenses and license detection rules #799 #774 #589
 * Licenses data now contains the full name as well as the short name.

 * License match have a notion of "coverage" which is the number of matched
   words compared to the number of words in the matched rule.
 * The license cache is not checked anymore for consistency once created which
   improved startup times. (unless you are using a Git checkout and you are 
   developping with a SCANCODE_DEV_MODE tag file present)
 * License catagory names have been improved

Copyrights:
 * Copyright detection in binary files has been improved
 * There are several improvements to the copyright detection quality fixing these
   tickets: #795 #677 #305 #795
 * There is a new post scan plugin that can be used to ignore certain copyright in
   the results

Summaries:
 * Add new support for  copyright summaries using smart holder deduplication #930

Misc:
 * Add options to limit the number of emails and urls that are collected from
   each file (with a default to 50) #384
 * When configuring in dev mode, VS Code settings are created
 * Archive detection has been improved
 * There is a new cache and temporary file configuration with --cache-dir and 
   --temp-dir CLI options. The --no-cache option has been removed
 * Add new --examples to show usage examples help
 * Move essential configuration to a scancode_config.py module
 * Only read a few pages from PDF files by default
 * Improve handling of files with weird characters in their names on all OSses
 * Improve detection of archive vs. comrpessed files
 * Make all copyright tests data driven using YAML files like for license tests
 

Plugins
 * Prescan plugins can now exclude files from the scans 
 * Plugins can now contribute arbitrary command line options #787 and #748
 * there is a new plugin stage called output_filter to optionally filter a scan before output.
   One example is to keep "only findings" #787
 * The core processing is centered now on a Codebase and Resource abstraction
   that represents the scanned filesystem in memory #717 #736
   All plugins operate on this abstraction
 * All scanners are also plugins #698 and now everything is a plugin including the scans
 * The interface for output plugins is the same as other plugins #715

v2.2.1 (2017-10-05)
-------------------

This is a minor release with several bug fixes, one new feature
and one (minor) API change.

* API change:

 * Licenses data now contains a new reference_url attribute instead of a
   dejacode_url attribute. This defaults to the public DejaCode URL and
   can be configured with the new --license-url-template command line
   option.

* New feature:

 * There is a new "--format jsonlines" output format option.
   In this format, each line in the output is a valid JSON document. The
   first line contains a "header" object with header-level data such as
   notice, version, etc. Each line after the first contains the scan
   results for a single file formatted with the same structure as a
   whole scan results JSON documents but without any header-level
   attributes. See also http://jsonlines.org/

* Other changes:

 * Several new and improved license detection rules have been added.
   The logic of detection has been refined to handle some rare corner
   cases. The underscore character "_" is treated as part of a license
   word and the handling of negative and false_positive license rules
   has been simplified.

 * Several issues with dealing with codebase with non-ASCII,
   non-UTF-decodable file paths and other filesystem encodings-related
   bug have been fixed.

 * Several copyright detection bugs have been fixed.
 * PHP Composer and RPM packages are now detected with --package
 * Several other package types are now detected with --package even
   though only a few attribute may be returned for now until full parser
   are added.
 * Several parsing NPM packages bugs have been fixed. 
 * There are some minor performance improvements when scanning some
   large file for licenses.


v2.1.0 (2017-09-22)
-------------------

This is a minor release with several new and improved features and bug
fixes but no significant API changes.

v2.0.0 (2017-06-23)
-------------------

 This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug
 fixes.
 
 Some of the key highlights include:

 * License:

   * Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple
     techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of
     a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.

   * Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses
     detection rules have been added making the detection significantly
     better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new
     detection engine)

   * the matched license text can be optionally returned with the
     `--license-text` option

   * The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection
     engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and
     comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.

   * improved scoring of license matches


 * Package and dependencies:

  * new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,
    NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,
    declared dependencies are also reported.

  * several additional package formats will be reported in the future
    version.

  * note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be
    considered API at this stage


 * Scan outputs: 

  * New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.

  * new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still
    available with the the `json-pp` format).
    The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a
    documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.

  * Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the
    html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode
    Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.


 * Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are
   no longer returned and copyrights are more accurate


 * Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive
   types (such as Spring boot shell archives)


 * Performance:

  * Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance
    has been significantly improved.

  * Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new 
    `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a
    full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about
    11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)

  * Reduced memory usage with the use of caching

 * Other notes:

   * This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support
   * The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120
     seconds default
   * ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package
     index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage
     will follow in future versions
   * New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and
     paths during a scan
   * New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data
   * The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or
     absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted
     path.
