2.0.0 (2017-06-23)
------------------

 This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug
 fixes.
 
 Some of the key highlights include:

 * License:

   * Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple
     techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of
     a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.

   * Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses
     detection rules have been added making the detection significantly
     better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new
     detection engine)

   * the matched license text can be optionally returned with the
     `--license-text` option

   * The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection
     engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and
     comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.

   * improved scoring of license matches


 * Package and dependencies:

  * new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,
    NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,
    declared dependencies are also reported.

  * several additional package formats will be reported in the future
    version.

  * note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be
    considered API at this stage


 * Scan outputs: 

  * New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.

  * new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still
    available with the the `json-pp` format).
    The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a
    documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.

  * Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the
    html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode
    Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.


 * Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are
   no longer returned and copyright s are more accurate


 * Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive
   types (such as Spring boot shell archives)


 * Performance:

  * Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance
    has been significantly improved.

  * Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new 
    `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a
    full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about
    11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)

  * Reduced memory usage with the use of caching

 * Other notes:

   * This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support
   * The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120
     seconds default
   * ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package
     index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage
     will follow in future versions
   * New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and
     paths during a scan
   * New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data
   * The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or
     absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted
     path.
