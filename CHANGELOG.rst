v32.0.5rc3 - 2023-06-23
------------------------

The previous release v32.0.5rc3 was failing on mac app release
tests, see https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3435
for more details. This release attempts to fix this and release
correctly.

v32.0.5rc2 - 2023-06-22
------------------------

The previous release v32.0.5rc1 failed to upload pypi wheels
because of file size limits enforced by pypi, and this release
is effectively the same as the previous one, but now the size
limit has been increased by https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2926
so this will upload the wheels correctly.

v32.0.5rc1 - 2023-06-12
------------------------

This is a minor bugfix release with the following updates:

- A new `--todo` option is added to show the todo items that
  should be reviewed, which are ambiguous license/package
  detections.

- New licenses and license detection rules. And other license
  detection fixes.

v32.0.4 - 2023-06-07
---------------------

This is a minor bugfix release with the following updates:

- Fixes a performance issue issue arising out of license detection
  on files happening in a single-threaded process_codebase step when the
  license CLI option is disabled for a package scan.
  Reference: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3423

v32.0.3 - 2023-06-06
---------------------

This is a minor bugfix release with the following updates:

- We were missing scancode-toolkit-mini releases from v32.0.0rc2 and
  also the scancode-toolkit release wheels including and after v32.0.0rc2 were
  actually scancode-toolkit-mini releases.
  Reference: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3421

- Updated github actions, for more details see https://github.com/nexB/skeleton/issues/75

v32.0.2 - 2023-05-26
---------------------

This is a minor bugfix release with the following update:

- New release v30.1.1 of license-expression with support for new license keys
  added. Also fail verbosely in `build_spdx_license_expression` for invalid and
  deprecated license keys.


v32.0.1 - 2023-05-23
---------------------

This is a minor bugfix release.

There are fixes for two issues in this release:
- https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3407:
  here in typecode we had an improper import of ctypes.utils
  and this is fixed in a new release v30.0.1 of typecode
- https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3408 
  the setup.cfg and setup-mini.cfg was not aligned for plugin
  entrypoints.


v32.0.0 - 2023-05-23
---------------------

Important API changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a major release with major API and output format changes and signicant
feature updates.

In particular the output format has changed for the licenses and packages, and
also for some of the command line options.

The output format version is now 3.0.0.


Other updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We have a new ``--todo`` CLI option to have todo items for reviewers
  with ambiguous license detections and package detections.
  This adds a new codebase-level attribute ``todo`` which is a list
  of ambiguous detections. Here the ambiguous detection attributes are:
  - detection_id: same license unique license detection identifier or top-level
    package identifier.
  - detection: this is either a license_detection or a package_data mapping.
  - review_comments: to explain the type of ambiguous detections.

Package detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update ``GemfileLockParser`` to track the gem which the Gemfile.lock is for,
  which we assign to the new ``GemfileLockParser.primary_gem`` field. Update
  ``GemfileLockHandler.parse()`` to handle the case where there is a primary gem
  detected from a gemfile.lock. If there is a primary gem, a single ``Package``
  is created and the detected gem data within the gemfile.lock are assigned as
  dependencies. If there is no primary gem, then all of the dependencies are
  collected into Package with no name and yielded.

  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3072

- Fix issue where dependencies were not reported when scanning an extracted
  Python project by modifying ``BaseExtractedPythonLayout.assemble()`` to favor
  using package data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory. Package
  data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory contains the dependency
  information collected from the requirements.txt file along side PKG-INFO.

  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3083

- Fix issue where we were returning incorrect purl package ``type`` for cocoapods.
  ``pods`` was being returned  as a purl type for cocoapods, it should be
  ``cocoapods`` instead.
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst#cocoapods

  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3081

- Code for parsing a Maven POM, npm package.json, freebsd manifest and haxelib
  JSON have been separated into two functions: one that creates a PackageData
  object from the parsed Resource, and another that calls the previous function
  and yields the PackageData. This was done such that we can use the package
  manifest data parsing code outside of the scancode-toolkit context in other
  libraries.

- The PackageData model now includes a ``holder`` field, which is populated with
  holder data extracted from the copyright field if copyright data is present,
  otherwise it remains empty.

  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3290

- DatafileHandlers now have a classmethod named ``get_top_level_resources()``,
  which is supposed to yield the top-level Resources of a Package codebase,
  relative to a Package manifest file. ``maven.MavenPomXmlHandler`` is the first
  DatafileHandler that has this method implemented.


License detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The SPDX license list has been updated to the latest v3.20

- This is a major update to license detection where we now combine one or more
  license matches in a larger license detection. This approach improves the
  accuracy of license detection and removes a larger number of false positive
  or ambiguous license detections. See for details
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2878

- There is a new ``license_detections`` codebase level attribute with all the
  unique license detections in the whole scan, both in resources and packages.
  This has the 3 attributes also present in package/resource level license
  detections: ``license_expression``, ``identifier`` and ``detection_log``
  (present optionally if the ``--license-diagnostics`` option is enabled) with
  an additional attribute:

  - ``count``: Number of times in the codebase this unique license detection
    was encountered.

- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for licenses at file level:

  - The ``licenses`` attribute is deleted.

  - A new ``license_detections`` attribute contains license detections in that file.
    This object has three attributes: ``license_expression``, ``identifier``
    and ``matches``. ``matches`` is a list of license matches and is roughly
    the same as  ``licenses`` in the previous version with additional structure
    changes detailed below. Identifier is the detected license-expression with an
    UUID generated from the content of ``matches`` such that this is unique for
    unique detections. We also have another attribute ``detection_log`` with
    diagnostics information if the ``--license-diagnostics`` option is enabled.

  - A new attribute ``license_clues`` contains license matches with the
    same data structure as the ``matches`` attribute in ``license_detections``.
    This contains license matches that are mere clues and where not considered
    to be a proper conclusive license detection.

  - The ``license_expressions`` list of license expressions is deleted and
    replaced by a ``detected_license_expression`` single expression.
    Similarly ``spdx_license_expressions`` was removed and replaced by
    ``detected_license_expression_spdx``.

  - See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-resource>`_
    for examples and details.

- The data structure of license attributes in ``package_data`` and the codebase
  level ``packages`` has been updated accordingly:

  - There is a new ``license_detections`` attribute for the primary, top-level
    declared licenses of a package and an ``other_license_detections`` attribute
    for the other secondary detections.

  - The ``license_expression`` is replaced by the ``declared_license_expression``
    and ``other_license_expression`` attributes with their SPDX counterparts
    ``declared_license_expression_spdx`` and ``other_license_expression_spdx``.
    These expressions are parallel to detections.

  - The ``declared_license`` attribute is renamed ``extracted_license_statement``
    and is now a YAML-encoded string, which can be parsed to recreate the
    original extracted license statement. Previously this used to be nested
    python objects lists/dicts/string, but now this is always a YAML string.

    See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-package>`_
    for examples and details.

- The license matches structure has changed: we used to report one match for each
  license ``key`` of a matched license expression. We now report instead one
  single match for each matched license expression, and list the license keys
  as a ``licenses`` attribute. This avoids data duplication.
  Inside each match, we list each match and matched rule attributred directly
  avoiding nesting. See `license updates doc <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/license-detection-reference.html#licensematch-result-data>`_
  for examples and details.

- There are new and codebase level attributes with ``--license-references`` to report
  reference license metadata and texts once for each license matched across the
  scan; we now have two codebase level attributes: ``license_references`` and
  ``license_rule_references`` that list unique detected license and license rules.
  for examples and details. This reference data is also removed from license matches
  in all levels i.e. from codebase, package and resource level license detections and
  resource level license clues, irrespective of this CLI option being used, i.e. default
  with ``--licenses``.
  See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/license-detection-reference.html#comparision-before-after-license-references>`_

- We replaced the ``scancode --reindex-licenses`` command line option with a
  new separate command named ``scancode-reindex-licenses``.

  - The ``--reindex-licenses-for-all-languages`` CLI option is also moved to
    the ``scancode-reindex-licenses`` command as an option ``--all-languages``.

  - We can now detect licenses using custom license texts and license rules
    stored in a directory or packaged as a plugin for consistent reuse and deployment.

  - There is an ``--additional-directory`` option with the ``scancode-reindex-licenses``
    command to add the licenses from a directory.

  - There is also a ``--only-builtin`` option to use ony builtin licenses
    ignoring any additional license plugins.

  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/480 for more details.

- We combined the license data file and text file of each license in a single
  file with a .LICENSE extension. The .yml data file is now included at the
  top of each .LICENSE file as "YAML frontmatter". The same applies to license
  rules and their .RULE and .yml files. This halves the number of data files
  from about 60,000 to 30,000. Git line history is preserved for the combined
   text + yml files.

  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3049

- There is a new console script ``scancode-license-data`` to export
  license data in JSON, YAML and HTML, with indexes and a static website for use
  in the licensedb web site. This becomes the  API way to getr scancode license
  data.

  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2738

- The deprecated "--is-license-text" option has been removed.
  This is now built-in with the --license-text option and --info
  and exposed with the "percentage_of_license_text" attribute.

- The license dump() has been modified to add an extra space at empty
  newlines for license files which also have multiple indentation levels
  as this was generating invalid YAML output files when ``--license-text``
  or ``--license-references`` was enabled.

  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3219

- A bugfix has been added to the ``--unknown-licenses`` option where
  we would crash when using this option without using ``--matched-text``
  option. This is now working correctly and also better tested.

  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3343

v31.0.0 - 2022-08-17
-----------------------

This is a major release with important bug and security fixes, new and improved
features and API changes.

Note that we no longer support Python 3.6. Use Python 3.7+ instead.


Important API changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for copyrights, authors
  and holders. We now use a proper name for attributes and not a generic "value".

- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for packages. We now
  return "package_data" package information at the manifest file-level
  rather than "packages". This has all the data attributes of a "package_data"
  field plus others: "package_uuid", "package_data_files" and "files".

  - There is a a new top-level "packages" attribute that contains package
    instances that can be aggregating data from multiple manifests.

  - There is a a new top-level "dependencies" attribute that contains each
    dependency instance, these can be standalone or releated to a package.
    These contain a new "extra_data" object.

  - There is a new resource-level attribute "for_packages" which refers to
    packages through package_uuids (pURL + uuid string).

- The data structure for HTML output has been changed to include emails and
  urls under the  "infos" object. The HTML template displays output for holders,
  authors, emails, and urls into separate tables like "licenses" and "copyrights".

- The data structure for CSV output has been changed to rename the Resource
  column to "path". "copyright_holder" has been renamed to "holder"

- The license clarity scoring plugin has been overhauled to show new license
  clarity criteria. More details of the new scoring criteria are provided below.

- The functionality of the summary plugin has been imprived to provide declared
  origin and license information for the codebase being scanned. The previous
  summary plugin functionality has been preserved in the new ``tallies`` plugin.
  More details are provided below.

- ScanCode has adopted the new code skeleton from https://github.com/nexB/skeleton
  The key change is the location of the virtual environment. It used to be
  created at the root of the scancode-toolkit directory. It is now created
  under the ``venv`` subdirectory. You mus be aware of this if you use ScanCode
  from a git clone

- ``DatafileHandler.assemble()``, ``DatafileHandler.assemble_from_many()``, and
  the other ``.assemble()`` methods from the other Package handlers from
  packagedcode, have been updated to yield Package items before Dependency or
  Resource items. This is particulary important in the case where we are calling
  the ``assemble()`` method outside of the scancode-toolkit context, where we
  need to ensure that a Package exists before we assocate a Resource or
  Dependency to it.

Copyright detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The data structure in the JSON is now using consistently named attributes as
  opposed to plain values.
- Several copyright detection bugs have been fixed.
- French and German copyright detection is improved.
- Some spurious trailing dots in holders are not stripped.


License detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There have been significant license detection rules and licenses updates:

  - 107 new licenses have been added (total is now 1954)
  - 6780 new license detection rules have been added (total is now 32259)
  - 6753 existing false positive license rules have been removed (see below).
  - The SPDX license list has been updated to the latest v3.17

- The rule attribute "only_known_words" has been renamed to "is_continuous" and its
  meaning has been updated and expanded. A rule tagged as "is_continuous" can only
  be matched if there are no gaps between matched words, be they stopwords, extra
  unknown or known words. This improves several false positive license detections.
  The processing for "is_continous" has been merged in "key phrases" processing
  below.

- Key phrases can now be defined in a RULE text by surrounding one or more words
  with double curly braces `{{` and `}}`. When defined a RULE will only match
  when the key phrases match exactly. When all the text of rule is a "key phrase",
  this is the same as being "is_continuous".

- The "--unknown-licenses" option now also detects unknown licenses using a
  simple and effective ngrams-based matching in area that are not matched or
  weakly matched. This helps detects things that look like a license but are not
  yet known as licenses.

- False positive detection of "license lists" like the lists seen in license and
  package management tools has been entirely reworked. Rather than using
  thousands of small false positive rules, there is a new filter to detect a
  long run of license references and tags that is typical of license lists.
  As a results, thousands of rules have been replaced by a simpler filter, and
  the license detection is more accurate, faster and has fewer false
  positives.

- The new license flag "is_generic" tags licenses that are "generic" licenses
  such as "other-permissive" or "other-copyleft". This is not yet
  returned in the JSON API.

- When scanning binary files, the detection of single word rules is filtered when
  surrounded by gibberish or mixed case. For instance $#%$GpL$ is a false
  positive and is no longer reported.

- Several rules we tagged as is_license_notice incorrectly but were references
  and have been requalified as is_license_reference. All rules made of a single
  ord have been requalified as is_license_reference if they were not qualified
  this way.

- Matches to small license rules (with small defined as under 15 words)
  that are scattered over too many lines are now filtered as false matches.

- Small, two-words matches that overlap the previous or next match by
  by the word "license" and assimilated are now filtered as false matches.

- The new --licenses-reference option adds a new "licenses_reference" top
  level attribute to a scan when using the JSON and YAML outputs. This contains
  all the details and the full text of every license seen in a file or
  package license expression of a scan. This can be added added after the fact
  using the --from-json option.

- New experimental support for non-English licenses. Use the command
  ./scancode --reindex-licenses-for-all-languages to index all known non-English
  licenses and rules. From that point on, they will be detected. Because of this
  some licenses that were not tagged with their languages are now correctly
  tagged and they may not be detected unless you activate this new indexing
  feature.


Package detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Major changes in package detection and reporting, codebase-level attribute `packages`
  with one or more `package_data` and files for the packages are reported.
  The specific changes made are:

  - The resource level attribute `packages` has been renamed to `package_data`,
    as these are really package data that are being detected, such as manifests,
    lockfiles or other package data. This has the data attributes of a `package_data`
    field plus others: `package_uuid`, `package_data_files` and `files`.

  - A new top-level attribute `packages` has been added which contains package
    instances created from `package_data` detected in the codebase.

  - A new codebase level attribute `dependencies` has been added which contains dependency
    instances created from lockfiles detected in the codebase.

  - The package attribute `root_path` has been deleted from `package_data` in favour
    of the new format where there is no root conceptually, just a list of files for each
    package.

  - There is a new resource-level attribute `for_packages` which refers to
    packages through package_uids (pURL + uuid string). A `package_adder`
    function is now used to associate a Package to a Resource that is part of
    it. This gives us the flexibility to use the packagedcode Package handlers
    in other contexts where `for_packages` on Resource is not implemented in the
    same way as scancode-toolkit.

  - The package_data attribute `dependencies` (which is a list of DependentPackages),
    now has a new attribute `resolved_package` with a package data mapping.
    Also the `requirement` attribute is renamed to `extracted_requirement`.
    There is a new `extra_data` to collect extra data as needed.

- For Pypi packages, python_requires is treated as a package dependency.


License Clarity Scoring Update:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We are moving away from the original license clarity scoring designed for
  ClearlyDefined in the license clarity score plugin. The previous license
  clarity scoring logic produced a score that was misleading when it would
  return a low score due to the stringent scoring criteria. We are now using
  more general criteria to get a sense of what provenance information has been
  provided and whether or not there is a conflict in licensing between what
  licenses were declared at the top-level key files and what licenses have been
  detected in the files under the top-level.

- The license clarity score is a value from 0-100 calculated by combining the
  weighted values determined for each of the scoring elements:

  - Declared license:

    - When true, indicates that the software package licensing is documented at
      top-level or well-known locations in the software project, typically in a
      package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README file.
    - Scoring Weight = 40

  - Identification precision:

    - Indicates how well the license statement(s) of the software identify known
      licenses that can be designated by precise keys (identifiers) as provided in
      a publicly available license list, such as the ScanCode LicenseDB, the SPDX
      license list, the OSI license list, or a URL pointing to a specific license
      text in a project or organization website.
    - Scoring Weight = 40

  - License texts:

    - License texts are provided to support the declared license expression in
      files such as a package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README.
    - Scoring Weight = 10

  - Declared copyright:

    - When true, indicates that the software package copyright is documented at
      top-level or well-known locations in the software project, typically in a
      package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README file.
    - Scoring Weight = 10

  - Ambiguous compound licensing:

    - When true, indicates that the software has a license declaration that
      makes it difficult to construct a reliable license expression, such as in
      the case of multiple licenses where the conjunctive versus disjunctive
      relationship is not well defined.
    - Scoring Weight = -10

  - Conflicting license categories:

    - When true, indicates that the declared license expression of the software
      is in the permissive category, but that other potentially conflicting
      categories, such as copyleft and proprietary, have been detected in lower
      level code.
    - Scoring Weight = -20


Summary Plugin Update:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The summary plugin's behavior has been changed. Previously, it provided a
  count of the detected license expressions, copyrights, holders, authors, and
  programming languages from a scan.

  We have preserved this functionality by creating a new plugin called ``tallies``.
  All functionality of the previous summary plugin have been preserved in the
  tallies plugin.

- The new summary plugin now attempts to determine a declared license expression,
  declared holder, and the primary programming language from a scan. And the
  updated license clarity score provides context on the quality  of the license
  information provided in the codebase key files.

- The new summary plugin also returns lists of tallies for the other "secondary"
  detected license expressions, copyright holders, and programming languages.

All summary information is provided at the codebase-level attribute named ``summary``.


Outputs:
~~~~~~~~

- Added new outputs for the CycloneDx format.
  The CLI now exposes options to produce CycloneDx BOMs in either JSON or XML format

- A new field ``warnings`` has been added to the headers of ScanCode toolkit output
  that contains any warning messages that occur during a scan.

- The CSV output format --csv option is now deprecated. It will be replaced by
  new CSV and tabular output formats in the next ScanCode release.

  correct minor documentation issues.


Development environment and Code API changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The main package API function `get_package_infos` is deprecated, and
  replaced by `get_package_data`.

- The Resources path are always the same regardless of the strip-root or
  full-root arguments.

- The license cache consistency is not checked anymore when you are using a git
  checkout. The SCANCODE_DEV_MODE tag file has been removed entirely. Use
  instead the --reindex-licenses option to rebuild the license index.

- We can now regenerate test fixtures using the new SCANCODE_REGEN_TEST_FIXTURES
  environment variable. There is no need to replace the regen=False with
  regen=True in the code.


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v30.1.0 - 2021-09-25
--------------------

This is a bug fix release for these bugs:

- https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2717

We now return the package in the summaries as before.

There is also a minor API change: we no longer return a count of "null" empty
values in the summaries for license, copyrights, etc.


Thank you to:
- Thomas Druez @tdruez



v30.0.1 - 2021-09-24
--------------------

We now correctly work with all supported Click versions.

Thank you to:
- Konstantin Kochin @vznncv
- Thomas Druez @tdruez



v30.0.0 - 2021-09-23
--------------------

This is a major release with new features, and several bug fixes and
improvements including major updates to the license detection.

We have droped using calendar-based versions and are now switched back to semver
versioning. To ensure that there is no ambiguity, the new major version has been
updated from 21 to 30. The primary reason is that calver was not helping
integrators to track major version changes like semver does.

We also have introduced a new JSON output format version based on semver to
version the JSON output format data structure and have documented the new
versioning approach.


Package detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Debian packages declared license detection in machine readable copyright
  files and unstructured copyright has been significantly improved with the
  tracking of the detection start and end line of a license match. This is not
  yet exposed outside of tests but has been essential to help improve detection.

- Debian copyright license detection has been significantly improved with new
  license detection rules.

- Support for Windows packages has been improved (and in particular the handling
  of Windows packages detection in the Windows registry).

- Support for Cocoapod packages has been significantly revamped and is now
  working as expected.

- Support for PyPI packages has been refined, in particular package descriptions.



Copyright detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The copyright detection accuracy has been improved and several bugs have been
  fixed.


License detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been some significant updates in license detection. We now track
34,164 license and license notices:

  - 84 new licenses have been added,
  - 34 existing license metadata have been updated,
  - 2765 new license detection rules have been added, and
  - 2041 existing license rules have been updated.


- Several license detection bugs have fixed.

- The SPDX license list 3.14 is now supported and has been synced with the
  licensedb. We also include the version of the SPDX license list in the
  ScanCode YAML, JSON and the SPDX outputs, as well as display it with the
  "--version" command line option.

- Unknown licenses have a new flag "is_unknown" in their metadata to identify
  them explicitly. Before that we were just relying on the naming convention of
  having "unknown" as part of a license key.

- Rules that match at least one unknown license have a flag "has_unknown" set
  and returned in the match results.

- Experimental: License detection can now "follow" license mentions that
  reference another file such as "see license in COPYING" where we can relate
  this mention to the actual license detected in the COPYING file. Use the new
  "--unknown-licenses" command line option to test this new feature.
  This feature will evolve significantly in the next version(s).


Outputs:
~~~~~~~~

- The SPDX output now has the mandatory ids attribute per SPDX spec. And we
  support SPDX 2.2 and SPDX license list 3.14.


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There is a new "--no-check-version" CLI option to scancode to bypass live,
  remote outdated version check on PyPI

- The scan results and the CLI now display an outdated version warning when
  the installed ScanCode version is older than 90 days. This is to warn users
  that they are relying on outdated, likely buggy, insecure and inaccurate scan
  results and encourage them to update to a newer version. This is made entirely
  locally based on date comparisons.

- We now display again the command line progressbar counters correctly.

- A bug has been fixed in summarization.

- Generated code detection has been improved with several new keywords.


Thank you!

that are not yet fully documented but it can be used for testing.

API changes:
 - Command line API

  - `--diag` option renamed to `--license-diag`

  - `--format <format code>` option has been replaced by multiple options one
    for each format such as `--format-csv` `--format-json` and multiple formats
    can be requested at once

  - new experimental `--cache-dir` option and `SCANCODE_CACHE` environment variable
    and `--temp-dir` and `SCANCODE_TMP` environment variable to set the temp and
    cache directories.

 - JSON data output format: no major changes

 - programmatic API in scancode/api.py:

  - get_urls(location, threshold=50): new threshold argument

  - get_emails(location, threshold=50): new threshold argument

  - get_file_infos renamed to get_file_info

  - Resource moved to scancode.resource and significantly updated

Command line
 - You can select multiple outputs at once (e.g. JSON and CSV, etc.) #789
 - There is a new capability to reload a JSON scan to reprocess it with postcsan
   plugins and or converting a JSON scan to CSV or else.


Licenses:
 - There are several new and improved licenses and license detection rules #799 #774 #589
 - Licenses data now contains the full name as well as the short name.

 - License match have a notion of "coverage" which is the number of matched
   words compared to the number of words in the matched rule.
 - The license cache is not checked anymore for consistency once created which
   improved startup times. (unless you are using a Git checkout and you are
   developping with a SCANCODE_DEV_MODE tag file present)
 - License catagory names have been improved

Copyrights:
 - Copyright detection in binary files has been improved
 - There are several improvements to the copyright detection quality fixing these
   tickets: #795 #677 #305 #795
 - There is a new post scan plugin that can be used to ignore certain copyright in
   the results

Summaries:
 - Add new support for  copyright summaries using smart holder deduplication #930

Misc:

 - there is a new plugin stage called output_filter to optionally filter a scan before output.
   One example is to keep "only findings" #787
 - The core processing is centered now on a Codebase and Resource abstraction
   that represents the scanned filesystem in memory #717 #736
   All plugins operate on this abstraction
 - All scanners are also plugins #698 and now everything is a plugin including the scans
 - The interface for output plugins is the same as other plugins #715

v2.2.1 (2017-10-05)
-------------------

This is a minor release with several bug fixes, one new feature
and one (minor) API change.

API change:
~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Licenses data now contains a new reference_url attribute instead of a
   dejacode_url attribute. This defaults to the public DejaCode URL and
   can be configured with the new --license-url-template command line
   option.

New feature:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - There is a new "--format jsonlines" output format option.
   In this format, each line in the output is a valid JSON document. The
   first line contains a "header" object with header-level data such as
   notice, version, etc. Each line after the first contains the scan
   results for a single file formatted with the same structure as a
   whole scan results JSON documents but without any header-level
   attributes. See also http://jsonlines.org/

Other changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Several new and improved license detection rules have been added.
   The logic of detection has been refined to handle some rare corner
   cases. The underscore character "_" is treated as part of a license
   word and the handling of negative and false_positive license rules
   has been simplified.

 - Several issues with dealing with codebase with non-ASCII,
   non-UTF-decodable file paths and other filesystem encodings-related
   bug have been fixed.

 - Several copyright detection bugs have been fixed.
 - PHP Composer and RPM packages are now detected with --package
 - Several other package types are now detected with --package even
   though only a few attribute may be returned for now until full parser
   are added.
 - Several parsing NPM packages bugs have been fixed.
 - There are some minor performance improvements when scanning some
   large file for licenses.


v2.1.0 (2017-09-22)
-------------------

This is a minor release with several new and improved features and bug
fixes but no significant API changes.

 - New plugin architecture by @yashdsaraf

  - we can now have pre-scan, post-scan and output format plugins
  - there is a new CSV output format and some example, experimental plugins
  - the CLI UI has changed to better support these plugins

 - New and improved licenses and license detection rules including
   support for EPL-2.0 and OpenJDK-related licensing and synchronization
   with the latest SPDX license list

 - Multiple bug fixes such as:

   - Ensure that authors are reported even if there is no copyright #669
   - Fix Maven package POM parsing infinite loop #721
   - Improve handling of weird non-unicode byte paths #688 and #706
   - Improve PDF parsing to avoid some crash #723

v2.0.1 (2017-07-03)
-------------------

 This is a minor release with minor new and improved features and bug
 fixes.

   for #534
 - Bug fixed in License detection leading to a very long scan time for some
   rare JavaScript files. Reported by @jarnugirdhar
 - New "base_name" attribute returned with file information. Reported by
   @chinyeungli
 - Bug fixed in Maven POM package detection. Reported by @kalagp


v2.0.0 (2017-06-23)
-------------------

 This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug
 fixes.

 Some of the key highlights include:

License detection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple
     techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of
     a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.

   - Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses
     detection rules have been added making the detection significantly
     better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new
     detection engine)

   - the matched license text can be optionally returned with the
     `--license-text` option

   - The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection
     engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and
     comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.

   - improved scoring of license matches


Package and dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,
    NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,
    declared dependencies are also reported.

  - several additional package formats will be reported in the future
    version.

  - note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be
    considered API at this stage


Scan outputs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.

  - new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still
    available with the the `json-pp` format).
    The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a
    documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.

  - Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the
    html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode
    Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.


 - Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are
   no longer returned and copyrights are more accurate


 - Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive
   types (such as Spring boot shell archives)


Performance:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance
    has been significantly improved.

  - Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new
    `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a
    full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about
    11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)

  - Reduced memory usage with the use of caching

Other notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support
   - The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120
     seconds default
   - ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package
     index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage
     will follow in future versions
   - New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and
     paths during a scan
   - New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data
   - The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or
     absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted
     path.
