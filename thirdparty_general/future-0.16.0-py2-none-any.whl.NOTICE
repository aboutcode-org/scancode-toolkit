The backported super() and range() functions are derived from Ryan Kelly’s magicsuper module and Dan Crosta’s xrange module.
The futurize and pasteurize scripts use lib2to3, lib3to2, and parts of Armin Ronacher’s python-modernize code.
The python_2_unicode_compatible decorator is from Django. The implements_iterator and with_metaclass decorators are from Jinja2.
The exec_ function and some others in future.utils are from the six module by Benjamin Peterson.
The raise_ and raise_with_traceback functions were contributed by Jeff Tratner.
A working version of raise_from was contributed by Varriount (GitHub).
Documentation is generated with Sphinx using the sphinx-bootstrap theme.
past.translation is inspired by and borrows some code from Sanjay Vinip’s uprefix module.

About the IPython Development Team
----------------------------------

Fernando Perez began IPython in 2001 based on code from Janko Hauser
<jhauser@zscout.de> and Nathaniel Gray <n8gray@caltech.edu>.  Fernando is still
the project lead.

The IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython
project.  This includes all of the IPython subprojects. A full list with
details is kept in the documentation directory, in the file
``about/credits.txt``.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
https://github.com/ipython/.

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the IPython repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file 
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

::

    # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.
