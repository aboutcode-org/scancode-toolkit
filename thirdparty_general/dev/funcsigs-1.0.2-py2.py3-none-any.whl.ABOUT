description: funcsigs is a backport of the PEP 362 function signature features from
    Python 3.3's inspect module. The backport is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7 as
    well as 3.3 and up. 3.2 was supported by version 0.4, but with setuptools and
    pip no longer supporting 3.2, we cannot make any statement about 3.2 compatibility.
