This is the test data from slic, the Speedy LIcense Checker by Gervase Markham

There is a test suite which makes sure it continues to correctly detect the
licenses it already knows about. This uses the "nose" testing framework -
simply run "nosetests" to run the test suite. You can add files to the slic
detection test suite easily using the add_test_case script.

The license is the MPL-2.0
