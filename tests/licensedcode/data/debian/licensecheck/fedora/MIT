=== Notes ===
This license contains a title preservation clause, which can literally be read as a purported requirement to assign copyright in derivative works upstream to OpenVision. However, the use of the word "retained" suggests instead that it should be read as a mere assertion of persistence of copyright in derivative works.

Since this would automatically occur, as long as code persists from the original OpenVision copyrighted code base, under this interpretation, this becomes functionally equivalent to MIT.

=== Notes ===
This MIT variant is worded in a slightly confusing manner and does not include a warranty disclaimer.
While this is technically free (and GPL-compatible), we do not recommend its use.

=== Variant Text ===
Yes, there is a variant of this variant, replacing the "non-commercial or commercial purposes and without fee" wording that is confusing with "any purpose with or without fee". It is still free (and GPL-compatible), but because of the absence of any warranty disclaimer, we do not recommend its use.

== Cheusov variant ==
=== Notes ===
This variant does not give explicit permission to redistribute unmodified copies, however, since it does give permission to "copy" unmodifed copies, we are interpreting it that way. Also, since it does grant explicit permission to redistribute modified code, we feel the intent was to grant permission to redistribute unmodified copies as well. That said, this license is poorly worded, and we do not recommend its use.
