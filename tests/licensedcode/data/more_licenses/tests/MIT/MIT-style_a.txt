# Note: Please keep this module compatible to Python 1.5.2.

# Still needed:
# * more support for WinCE
# * support for MS-DOS (PythonDX ?)
# * support for Amiga and other still unsupported platforms running Python
# * support for additional Linux distributions
#

#
# History:
#
# <see CVS and SVN checkin messages for history>
#
# 1.0.3 - added normalization of Windows system name
# 1.0.2 - added more Windows support
# 1.0.1 - reformatted to make doc.py happy
# 1.0.0 - reformatted a bit and checked into Python CVS
# 0.8.0 - added sys.version parser and various new access
# APIs (python_version(), python_compiler(), etc.)
# 0.7.2 - fixed architecture() to use sizeof(pointer) where available
# 0.7.1 - added support for Caldera OpenLinux
# 0.7.0 - some fixes for WinCE; untabified the source file
# 0.6.2 - support for OpenVMS - requires version 1.5.2-V006 or higher and
# vms_lib.getsyi() configured
# 0.6.1 - added code to prevent 'uname -p' on platforms which are
# known not to support it
# 0.6.0 - fixed win32_ver() to hopefully work on Win95,98,NT and Win2k;
# did some cleanup of the interfaces - some APIs have changed
# 0.5.5 - fixed another type in the MacOS code... should have
# used more coffee today ;-)
# 0.5.4 - fixed a few typos in the MacOS code
# 0.5.3 - added experimental MacOS support; added better popen()
# workarounds in _syscmd_ver() -- still not 100% elegant
# though
# 0.5.2 - fixed uname() to return '' instead of 'unknown' in all
# return values (the system uname command tends to return
# 'unknown' instead of just leaving the field emtpy)
# 0.5.1 - included code for slackware dist; added exception handlers
# to cover up situations where platforms don't have os.popen
# (e.g. Mac) or fail on socket.gethostname(); fixed libc
# detection RE
# 0.5.0 - changed the API names referring to system commands to *syscmd*;
# added java_ver(); made syscmd_ver() a private
# API (was system_ver() in previous versions) -- use uname()
# instead; extended the win32_ver() to also return processor
# type information
# 0.4.0 - added win32_ver() and modified the platform() output for WinXX
# 0.3.4 - fixed a bug in _follow_symlinks()
# 0.3.3 - fixed popen() and "file" command invokation bugs
# 0.3.2 - added architecture() API and support for it in platform()
# 0.3.1 - fixed syscmd_ver() RE to support Windows NT
# 0.3.0 - added system alias support
# 0.2.3 - removed 'wince' again... oh well.
# 0.2.2 - added 'wince' to syscmd_ver() supported platforms
# 0.2.1 - added cache logic and changed the platform string format
# 0.2.0 - changed the API to use functions instead of module globals
# since some action take too long to be run on module import
# 0.1.0 - first release
