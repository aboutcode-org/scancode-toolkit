In the late 1990's, the most stable version of SWIG was release
1.1p5. Versions 1.3.x were officially development versions and these were released
over a period of 10 years starting from the year 2000. The final version in the 1.3.x
series was 1.3.40, but in truth the 1.3.x series had been stable for many years.
An official stable version was released along with the decision to make SWIG
license changes and this gave rise to version 2.0.0 in 2010. The license was clarified
so that the code that SWIG generated could be distributed
under license terms of the user's choice/requirements and at the same time the SWIG
source was placed under the GNU General Public License version 3.
