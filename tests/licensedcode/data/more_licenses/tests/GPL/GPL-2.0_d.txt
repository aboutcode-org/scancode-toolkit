* Apple Onboard Audio driver for Onyx codec

*
*
* This is a driver for the pcm3052 codec chip (codenamed Onyx)
* that is present in newer Apple hardware (with digital output).
*
* The Onyx codec has the following connections (listed by the bit
* to be used in aoa_codec.connected):
* 0: analog output
* 1: digital output
* 2: line input
* 3: microphone input
* Note that even though I know of no machine that has for example
* the digital output connected but not the analog, I have handled
* all the different cases in the code so that this driver may serve
* as a good example of what to do.
*
* NOTE: This driver assumes that there's at most one chip to be
* used with one alsa card, in form of creating all kinds
* of mixer elements without regard for their existence.
* But snd-aoa assumes that there's at most one card, so
* this means you can only have one onyx on a system. This
* should probably be fixed by changing the assumption of
* having just a single card on a system, and making the
* 'card' pointer accessible to anyone who needs it instead
* of hiding it in the aoa_snd_* functions...
