prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
open-source development model.  You needn't inform anyone that you're

DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform
is Y2K-compliant.  Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US
daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of
2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for
the United States that expand DST as of March 2007.  Since DOC
software obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating
systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as
they upgrade their operating systems accordingly. <P>
