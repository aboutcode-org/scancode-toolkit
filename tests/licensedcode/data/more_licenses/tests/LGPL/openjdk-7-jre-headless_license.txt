A Note About License Headers
----------------------------

Some sources downloaded from openjdk.java.net do not display the GPL
license header.  Instances are:

 - The files in openjdk/j2se/src/share/classes/javax/xml/stream/ seem to 
   comprise the BEA-StAX source code

   http://ftpna2.bea.com/pub/downloads/jsr173.jar

   with some Sun-specific modifications.  We're assuming that Sun is
   bundling BEA-StAX under the terms of the Apache License 2.0 and
   that the modifications are owned by Sun.

 - We are assuming that these files are owned by Sun:
   openjdk/j2se/src/share/classes/**/resources/*.properties

The downloaded sources include a script that inserts proprietary
license headers into the source files it generates.  The script
itself is GPL'd so we patched them to emit the GPL header. The
file is:
  openjdk/j2se/make/java/nio/genExceptions.sh

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  are subject to
the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where
Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception
as provided by Sun in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPENJDK ASSEMBLY EXCEPTION

The OpenJDK source code made available by Sun at openjdk.java.net and
openjdk.dev.java.net ("OpenJDK Code") is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License  version 2
only ("GPL2"), with the following clarification and special exception.

    Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with other code
    is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms
    and conditions of GPL2 cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, Sun gives you permission to link this
    OpenJDK Code with certain code licensed by Sun as indicated at
    http://openjdk.java.net/legal/exception-modules-2007-05-08.html
    ("Designated Exception Modules") to produce an executable,
    regardless of the license terms of the Designated Exception Modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under GPL2,
    provided that the Designated Exception Modules continue to be
    governed by the licenses under which they were offered by Sun.

As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Sun's GPL2 OpenJDK Code to
build an executable that includes those portions of necessary code that Sun
could not provide under GPL2 (or that Sun has provided under GPL2 with the
Classpath exception).  If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code, that new
GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception Modules if the
new code is made subject to this exception by its copyright holder.

the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed
by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations. 
3.1. Application of License. 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
(a) Third Party Claims. 
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained. 
(b) Contributor APIs. 
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
file. 
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c)Â Â Â  Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.Â 
If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due
to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a
relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.Â 
If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.Â  You must also duplicate
this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.Â  You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.
5. Application of this License. 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6. Versions of the License. 
6.1. New Versions. 
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. 
6.2. Effect of New Versions. 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
6.3. Derivative Works. 
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'',
''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.
8. TERMINATION. 
8.1.Â  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive. 
8.2.Â  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
action is referred to as "Participant")Â  alleging that: 
(a)Â  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
notice You either: (i)Â  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
Contributor Version against such Participant.Â  If within 60 days of notice, a
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
(b)Â  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 
8.3.Â  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
or license. 
8.4.Â  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,Â  all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
survive termination.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING
FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed".Â  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in
the file described in Exhibit A.

(libjpeg), which may be included with this software: 

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used
the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with
respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness
for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its
user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software
(or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must
be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent
JPEG Group".

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO
LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed
by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by
the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that
you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c
for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same
holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is
also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF
decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."
