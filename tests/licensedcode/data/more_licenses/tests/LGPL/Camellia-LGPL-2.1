Camellia is a block cipher developed by Mitsubishi and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corporation, described in `RFC3713', and recommended by
some Japanese and European authorities as an alternative to AES. The
algorithm is patented. The implementation in Nettle is derived from the
implementation released by NTT under the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later), and
relies on the implicit patent license of the LGPL. There is also a
statement of royalty-free licensing for Camellia at
`http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news01e/0104/010417.html', but this
statement has some limitations which seem problematic for free software.

Camellia uses a the same block size and key sizes as AES: The block
size is 128 bits (16 octets), and the supported key sizes are 128, 192,
and 256 bits. Nettle defines Camellia in `<nettle/camellia.h>'.
