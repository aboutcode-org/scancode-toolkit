%description
ICU is a set of C and C++ libraries that provides robust and full-featured
Unicode and locale support. The library provides calendar support, conversions
for many character sets, language sensitive collation, date
and time formatting, support for many locales, message catalogs
and resources, message formatting, normalization, number and currency
formatting, time zones support, transliteration, word, line and
sentence breaking, etc.

This package contains the Unicode character database and derived
properties, along with converters and time zones data.

This package contains the runtime libraries for ICU. It does
not contain any of the data files needed at runtime and present in the
`icu' and `icu-locales` packages.
