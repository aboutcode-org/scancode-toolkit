MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function
with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security
applications, and is also commonly used to check the integrity of data. The
generated hash is also non-reversable. Data cannot be retrieved from the
message digest, the digest uniquely identifies the data.

 MD5 was developed by Professor Ronald L. Rivest in 1994. Its 128 bit (16 byte)
message digest makes it a faster implementation than SHA-1.

This script is used to process a variable length message into a fixed-length
output of 128 bits using the MD5 algorithm. It is fully compatible with UTF-8
encoding. It is very useful when u want to transfer encrypted passwords over
the internet. If you plan using UTF-8 encoding in your project don’t forget to
set the page encoding to UTF-8 (Content-Type meta tag).
