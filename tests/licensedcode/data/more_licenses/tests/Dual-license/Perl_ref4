# This code provides shortening of long symbols (> 31 characters) using the

# an AUTODIN II checksum of the entire symbol, encode the checksum in base32,
# and glue together a shortened symbol from the first 23 characters of the
# original symbol plus the encoded checksum appended. The output format is
# the same used in the name mangler database, stored by default in
