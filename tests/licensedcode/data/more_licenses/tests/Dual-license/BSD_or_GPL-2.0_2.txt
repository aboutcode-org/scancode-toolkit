/*
* Basic EISA bus support for the SGI Indigo-2.

* (C) 2002 Pascal Dameme <netinet@freesurf.fr>
* and Marc Zyngier <mzyngier@freesurf.fr>
*
* This code is released under both the GPL version 2 and BSD
* licenses. Either license may be used.
*
* This code offers a very basic support for this EISA bus present in
* the SGI Indigo-2. It currently only supports PIO (forget about DMA
* for the time being). This is enough for a low-end ethernet card,
* but forget about your favorite SCSI card...
*
* TODO :
* - Fix bugs...
* - Add ISA support
* - Add DMA (yeah, right...).
* - Fix more bugs.
