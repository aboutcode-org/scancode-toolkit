Sure. I assumed that since GPG was GPLd, you'd prefer the GPL for the entropy
code as well, but Ian asked for LGPL as an option so as of the next release
I'll have LGPL in there. You can consider it to be retroactive, so your
current version will be LGPLd as well.

Peter.

Sure, it covers the entire entropy-gathering subsystem.
