* Simple logical expression parser.
* This module implements a basic expression parser with support for
* integer and string datatypes. For ease of programming, we use the
* top-down "recursive descent" method of parsing. While a
* table-driven bottom-up parser might be faster, it does not really
* matter for the expressions we will be parsing.
