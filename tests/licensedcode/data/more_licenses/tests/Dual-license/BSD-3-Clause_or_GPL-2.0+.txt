* Xircom CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps driver
* Xircom Realport 10/100 (RE-100) driver
*
* This driver supports various Xircom CreditCard Ethernet adapters
* including the CE2, CE IIps, RE-10, CEM28, CEM33, CE33, CEM56,
* CE3-100, CE3B, RE-100, REM10BT, and REM56G-100.
*
* 2000-09-24 <psheer@icon.co.za> The Xircom CE3B-100 may not
* autodetect the media properly. In this case use the
* if_port=1 (for 10BaseT) or if_port=4 (for 100BaseT) options
* to force the media type.
*
* Written originally by Werner Koch based on David Hinds' skeleton of the
* PCMCIA driver.
