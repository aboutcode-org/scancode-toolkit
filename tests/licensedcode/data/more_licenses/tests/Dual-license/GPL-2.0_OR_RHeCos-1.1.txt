*
* Very simple lz77-ish encoder.
*
* Theory of operation: Both encoder and decoder have a list of "last
* occurances" for every possible source-value; after sending the
* first source-byte, the second byte indicated the "run" length of
* matches
*
* The algorithm is intended to only send "whole bytes", no bit-messing.
