THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH BUSINESSES ONLY AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR USE BY CONSUMERS. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WARRANTING THAT YOU ARE A BUSINESS AND ARE NOT ACTING AS A CONSUMER.

1. AGREEMENT

In this Agreement, "the Product" means the software product ''CCleaner''. 

This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (as a business entity) and Piriform Limited of 17 Cavendish Square, London ("Piriform") in relation to the provision of support services for the  Product, which is licensed to you pursuant to a license agreement between Piriform and you from time to time ("Licence"). 

All support services provided by Piriform to you, shall be on the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. By purchasing the support services, you are deemed to agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2. SUPPORT TERMS

In consideration of your payment of the applicable support fee, Piriform will endeavour to answer by email such number of your queries regarding the use or application of the Product as it deems reasonable. No representation or warranty is given that all queries will be responded to or responded to within a specified period of time. 

Queries should be submitted to Piriform using either of these methods:
•    http://support.piriform.com using such user account details as given to you by Piriform after your support account is enabled.  
•    Email direct to Piriform using such email address as given to you by Piriform after your support account is enabled.  

Upon receipt of full payment of the support fee, a user account will be automatically enabled for you on http://support.piriform.com and you will be sent an email notification confirming activation of your user account and confirming your user account details. 

Support fees and/or any applicable renewal fees are non-refundable. 

Piriform warrants to you that the support services will be performed with reasonable care and skill and in accordance with applicable UK laws and regulations. All other conditions, warranties or other terms which may be implied or incorporated into this Agreement whether by statute, common law or otherwise are hereby excluded. 

3. LIMITS OF SUPPORT 

Piriform shall only provide support services in respect of the most current version of the Product. Piriform will regularly make available new versions of the Product for download to you from its website, subject to separate licence terms. 

Piriform shall only provide support services up to and in respect of the number of Installations of the Product that you have specified and paid for under this Agreement. You must purchase support services in respect of all Installations of the Product made by you; where you fail to do so this support agreement shall immediately terminate without notice, and without refund or liability to you.

An ''Installation'' is defined as: 
(i) the installation of one copy of the Product on an individual physical device which does not have Virtualization Capability (as defined below); or 
(ii) each instance of the Product which is installed on a virtual machine operating on a device which has Virtualization Capability. 
Where one copy of the Product is installed on a server but is accessible by multiple devices (whether physical or virtual), the Product shall be deemed to be installed both on the server and on each such device and each shall therefore be deemed an "Installation" for the purposes of this clause.  

"Virtualization Capability" means making a single physical device appear to function as multiple virtual resources.

This paragraph 4 shall not apply where the claim or action in question is attributable to your use or possession of the Product other than in accordance with this Agreement or the Licence or use of a non-current release of the Product. This paragraph 4 is conditional upon you promptly giving written notice to Piriform specifying the nature of the claim or action and you not making any admission or compromise. This paragraph 4 constitutes your sole remedy and Piriform''s only liability in respect of any such claims or actions.
