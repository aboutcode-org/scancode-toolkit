Great Circle Associates (GCA) is the original developer of Majordomo,
a package for managing Internet mailing lists.  Since its initial
release, many organizations and individuals have contributed
enhancements and fixes, but the original copyright has been retained
by Great Circle Associates.

Majordomo is distributed in source code form, with almost all
modules written in Perl (there is one small C program), and runs
on many UNIX platforms.  Majordomo is not a supported product of
Great Circle Associates, but is made available for use on the following
basis.

GCA grants you a license as follows to the Majordomo package:

     1.  LICENSE.  GCA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable

and conditions.

     This license permits you to use, copy, and modify Majordomo
solely for your organization''s use.

     2.    LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE.

           a.    You may only use, copy, and modify Majordomo

                 revenue is received without written permission of
                 Great Circle Associates, with the following exceptions:
 
                     You may install Majordomo at your site and run
                     mailing lists for other using it, and charge for
                     that service.
      
                     You may install Majordomo at other sites, and
                     charge for your time to install, configure,
                     customize, and manage it.
      
                     You may charge for enhancements you''ve made to
                     the Majordomo software, subject to the distribution

                 You may not charge for the Majordomo software

                 A commercial license will be required in all other cases.

           c.    If Majordomo is being provided or configured for a
                 customer, the provider must clearly state in
                 documentation and bid/proposal materials that the
                 Majordomo technologies are licensed and provided
                 by Great Circle Associates, and a copy of this
                 license must be included with the configured
                 system.

           d.    Majordomo, if modified, must carry prominent notices

                 You may publicly distribute an unmodified and
                 complete version of Majordomo, for instance as
                 part of a collection of free software packages,
                 but you must distribute the whole package, and
                 you must tell people where they can obtain the

                 subject to the restrictions below, but not to the

                 anonymous FTP site).

                 You may not distribute (publicly or privately) a modified

                 documentation and/or comments in the code),
                 identifying who will be responsible for supporting
                 the modified version, and informing people receiving
                 the modified version where they can find an
                 unmodified version:
                     ftp://ftp.greatcircle.com/pub/majordomo/
