generally make Updates available for licensing to the public. Upon general availability of Updates during the 
Subscription Term, CITRIX shall provide you with Updates for covered Licenses. Any such Updates so 
delivered to you shall be considered SOFTWARE under the terms of this AGREEMENT, except they are not 
covered by the Limited Warranty applicable to SOFTWARE, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
Subscription may be purchased for the SOFTWARE until it is no longer offered in accordance with the CITRIX 
PRODUCT Support Lifecycle Policy posted at www.citrix.com.
You acknowledge that CITRIX may develop and market new or different computer programs or editions of the 
SOFTWARE that use portions of the SOFTWARE and that perform all or part of the functions performed by

which include SUPPORT (see Section 2 above), shall begin on the date of SUPPORT activation by CITRIX 
and shall run for a one (1) year term subject to your purchase of annual renewals. SUPPORT, including 
SUPPORT included as part of Subscription offerings, is sold including various combinations of Incidents, 
technical contacts, coverage hours, geographic coverage areas, technical relationship management coverage, 
and infrastructure assessment options. An “Incident” is defined as a single SUPPORT issue and reasonable 
effort(s) needed to resolve it. An Incident may require multiple telephone calls and offline research to achieve 
final resolution. The Incident severity will determine the response levels for the SOFTWARE. Unused Incidents 
or other entitlements expire at the end of each annual term. SUPPORT may be purchased for the SOFTWARE 
until it is no longer offered in accordance with the CITRIX PRODUCT Support Lifecycle Policy posted at 
www.citrix.com. SUPPORT will be provided remotely from CITRIX to your locations. Where on-site visits are 
mutually agreed, you will be billed for reasonable travel and living expenses in accordance with your travel 
policy. CITRIX’ performance is predicated upon the following responsibilities being fulfilled by you: (i) you 
will designate a Customer Support Manager (“CSM”) who will be the primary administrative contact; (ii) you 
will designate Named Contacts (including a CSM), preferably each CITRIX certified, and each Named Contact 
(excluding CSM) will be supplied with an individual service ID number for contacting SUPPORT; (iii) you 
agree to perform reasonable problem determination activities and to perform reasonable problem resolution 
activities as suggested by CITRIX. You agree to cooperate with such requests; (iv) you are responsible for 
implementing procedures necessary to safeguard the integrity and security of SOFTWARE and data from 
unauthorized access and for reconstructing any lost or altered files resulting from catastrophic failures; (v) you 
are responsible for procuring, installing, and maintaining all equipment, telephone lines, communications 
interfaces, and other hardware at your site and providing CITRIX with access to your facilities as required to 
operate the SOFTWARE and permitting CITRIX to perform the service called for by this AGREEMENT; and (vi) you are required to implement all currently available and applicable hotfixes, hotfix rollup packs, and 
service packs or their equivalent to the SOFTWARE in a timely manner. CITRIX is not required to provide any 
SUPPORT relating to problems arising out of: (i) your or any third party’s alterations or additions to the 
SOFTWARE, operating system or environment that adversely affects the SOFTWARE (ii) Citrix provided 
alterations or additions to the SOFTWARE that do not address Errors or Defects; (ii) any functionality not 
defined in the PRODUCT documentation published by CITRIX and included with the PRODUCT; (iii) use of 
the SOFTWARE on a processor and peripherals other than the processor and peripherals defined in the 
documentation; (iv) SOFTWARE that has reached End-of-Life; and (v) any consulting deliverables from any 
party. An “Error” is defined as a failure in the SOFTWARE to materially conform to the functionality defined 
in the documentation. A “Defect” is defined as a failure in the SOFTWARE to conform to the specifications in 
the documentation. In situations where CITRIX cannot provide a satisfactory resolution to your critical problem 
through normal SUPPORT methods, CITRIX may engage its product development team to create a private fix. 
Private fixes are designed to address your specific situation and may not be distributed by you outside your 
organization without written consent from CITRIX. CITRIX retains all right, title, and interest in and to all 
private fixes. Any hotfixes or private fixes are not SOFTWARE under the terms of this AGREEMENT and they 
are not covered by the Limited Warranty or Infringement Indemnification applicable to SOFTWARE, to the 
extent permitted by applicable law. With respect to infrastructure assessments or other consulting services, all 
intellectual property rights in all reports, preexisting works and derivative works of such preexisting works, as 
well as installation scripts and other deliverables and developments made, conceived, created, discovered, 
invented, or reduced to practice in the performance of the assessment or other consulting services are and shall 
remain the sole and absolute property of CITRIX, subject to a worldwide, nonexclusive License to you for 
internal use.
4. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBLIGATIONS. Unless expressly permitted by 
applicable law, you may not transfer, rent, timeshare, or lease the SOFTWARE. If you purchased Licenses for 
the SOFTWARE to replace other CITRIX Licenses for other CITRIX SOFTWARE and such replacement is a 
condition of the transaction, you agree to destroy those other CITRIX Licenses and retain no copies after 
installation of the new Licenses and SOFTWARE. You shall provide the serial numbers of such replaced 
Licenses and corresponding replacement Licenses to the reseller, and upon request, directly to CITRIX for 
license tracking purposes. Except as specifically licensed herein, you may not modify, translate, reverse 
engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works based on, or copy (except for backup as permitted 
above) the SOFTWARE, except to the extent such foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable 
law. You may not remove any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on any SOFTWARE. To the extent 
permitted by applicable law, you agree to allow CITRIX to audit your compliance with the terms of this 
AGREEMENT upon prior written notice during normal business hours. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this 
AGREEMENT shall not prevent or restrict you from exercising additional or different rights to any free, open 
source code, documentation and materials contained in or provided with the SOFTWARE in accordance with 
the applicable free, open source license for such code, documentation, and materials.

OR IN PART, OR GRANT ANY RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE OR ACCOMPANYING 
DOCUMENTATION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. ALL RIGHTS NOT 
EXPRESSLY GRANTED ARE RESERVED BY CITRIX OR ITS SUPPLIERS.
You hereby agree, that to the extent that any applicable mandatory laws (such as, for example, national laws 
implementing EC Directive 91/250 on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs) give you the right to 
perform any of the aforementioned activities without the consent of CITRIX to gain certain information about 
the SOFTWARE, before you exercise any such rights, you shall first request such information from CITRIX in 
writing detailing the purpose for which you need the information. Only if and after CITRIX, at its sole 
discretion, partly or completely denies your request, shall you exercise your statutory rights.

claim, suit, or proceeding brought against you based on an allegation that the XenServer Technology (excluding 
that received in free XenServer) infringes upon any patent or copyright of any third party (“Infringement 
Claim”), provided you promptly notify CITRIX in writing of your notification or discovery of an Infringement 
Claim such that CITRIX is not prejudiced by any delay in such notification. CITRIX will have sole control over 
the defense or settlement of any Infringement Claim and you will provide reasonable assistance in the defense 
of the same. Following notice of an Infringement Claim or if CITRIX believes such a claim is likely, CITRIX may at its sole expense and option: (i) procure for you the right to continue to use the alleged infringing
XenServer Technology; (ii) replace or modify the XenServer Technology to make it non-infringing; or (iii) 
accept return of the SOFTWARE and provide you with a refund as appropriate. CITRIX assumes no liability 
for any Infringement Claims or allegations of infringement based on: (i) your use of any XenServer Technology 
after notice that you should cease use of the same due to an Infringement Claim; (ii) any modification of the 
XenServer Technology by you or at your direction; or (iii) your combination of XenServer Technology with 
other programs, data, hardware, or other materials, if such Infringement Claim would have been avoided by the 
use of the XenServer Technology alone. THE FOREGOING STATES YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.
6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. CITRIX warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the 
date of delivery of the SOFTWARE (excluding free XenServer) to you, the SOFTWARE will perform 
substantially in accordance with the PRODUCT documentation published by CITRIX and included with the

subject to you returning the SOFTWARE to CITRIX or an authorized reseller) will be, at the sole option of 
CITRIX and subject to applicable law, to replace the media and/or SOFTWARE or to refund the purchase price 
and terminate this AGREEMENT. CITRIX will provide the SUPPORT requested by you in a professional and 
workmanlike manner, but CITRIX cannot guarantee that every question or problem raised by you will be 
resolved or resolved in a certain amount of time.

WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE, CITRIX AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE AND YOU RECEIVE NO 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE; AND CITRIX 
AND ITS SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM WITH RESPECT TO SOFTWARE, UPDATES, 
SUBSCRIPTION(INCLUDING SUBSCRIPTION WITH SUPPORT) AND SUPPORT ANY CONDITIONS
