compliance with Section 8 of this Agreement.
6. VERIFICATION

at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such
audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to
Licensee’s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during
regular business hours at Licensee''s facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere
with Licensee''s business activities. Nokia shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any
electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that Licensee is
using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the
Agreement, then Licensee shall pay Nokia''s reasonable costs of conducting the audit.
In the case of a material violation, Licensee agrees to pay Nokia any amounts owing

"Third Party Software") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does
not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party
Software may be included along with the Licensed Software delivery as a
convenience for development and testing only. Such source code and libraries may be
listed in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software or
documented in the Licensed Software where the Third Party Software is used, as may
be amended from time to time, do not comprise the Licensed Software. Licensee
acknowledges (1) that some part of Third Party Software may require additional
licensing of copyright and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution
of any of the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Software
may require appropriate licensing from such third parties.

the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (the
"Confidential Information"). Accordingly, when a party (the "Receiving Party")
receives Confidential Information from another party (the "Disclosing Party"), the
Receiving Party shall, and shall obligate its employees and agents and employees and
agents of its affiliates to: (i) maintain the Confidential Information in strict
confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the
Disclosing Party''s prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the
Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and
fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall take
6
reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other party, which

confidential and proprietary information.

generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (b)
was in the Receiving Party''s lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and
was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (c) is developed by the Receiving
Party without access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or by

obligation of confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to
disclose the information, in which case the Receiving Party shall assert the privileged
and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing
Party to protect against and prevent disclosure of any Confidential Information and to
limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential
Information by all legally available means.
The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue during the
Initial Term and for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination of this

improper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 13.10 is intended
