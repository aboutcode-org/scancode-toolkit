To use this source, import the project into Flash Builder 4.5.

You will need to have access to a playerglobal.swc that supports Flash Player 11.  Please update the project properties to point to your player global, otherwise a build error will occur.

Look in the media directory for some of the asset files and tools I used to make the project.
