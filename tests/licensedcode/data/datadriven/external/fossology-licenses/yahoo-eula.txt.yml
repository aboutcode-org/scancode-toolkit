notes: this is a license from fossology license reference Yahoo-EULA (Yahoo Software License)
  http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/toolbar/tbeula/tbeula-282.html This tests behaves differently
  between Python 2 and Python 3 due to differences in rounding causing different license match
  candidates to be selected for the license sequence matcher The expectations here are for Python
  3 and the test is expected to fail on Python 2, but is marked to fail everywhere When the
  Python 3 migration is complete, the expected failure should be removed.
