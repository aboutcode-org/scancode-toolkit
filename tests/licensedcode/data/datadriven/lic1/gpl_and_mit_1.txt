 *
 * This Plug-In will create a custom tooltip to replace the default
 * browser tooltip. It is extremely lightweight and very smart in
 * that it detects the edges of the browser window and will make sure
 * the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a result the
 * tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to the left 
 * or to the right depending on what is necessary to stay within the
 * browser window. It is completely customizable as well via CSS.
