  The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
  Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
  no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
  interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
  and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
  exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
  based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.
