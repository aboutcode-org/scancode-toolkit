Instead, it is the collective copyright of\nthe entire PyInstaller Development Team. If individual contributors want to\nmaintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright\non, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the\nchange, when they commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.\nWith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code\nfile to indicate the copyright and license terms:\n#--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Copyright (c) 2005-20l5, PyInstaller Development Team.\n#\n# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License with\n# exception for distributing bootloader.\n#\n# The full license is in the file COPYING.txt, distributed with this software.\n#--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
