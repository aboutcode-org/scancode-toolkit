<!-- The node element is recursive, a Node with a Value tag MUST always terminate the recursion. It is possible for a Node to omit both the next recursive Node and a Value, this means that the hierarchy of Nodes continues elsewhere. This can be used to increase readability of very deep trees.-->

<!--It is possible to indicate that a property has a default value by inserting the value as PCDATA. This does not apply to the Format property, which MUST use one of the enumerated values. The presence of a property tag, with or without value, indicates that this property is supported. -->
