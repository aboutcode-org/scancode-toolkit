        applied cryptography second edition which describes a stream cipher
        allegedly compatible with rsa labs rc4 cipher the actual description of
        which is a trade secret the same algorithm is used as a stream cipher
        called in tatu ylonen s ssh package here the stream cipher has been
        modified always to include the time when the state that makes it
        impossible to regenerate the same random sequence twice so this can t be
        used for encryption but will generate good random numbers rc4 is a
        registered trademark of rsa laboratories this code implements the md5
        message digest algorithm the algorithm is due to this code was written
        by colin plumb in 1993 no copyright is claimed this code is in the
        public domain do with it what you wish equivalent code is available from
        rsa data security inc this code has been tested against that and is
        equivalent except that you don t need to include two pages of legalese
        with every copy to compute the message digest of a of bytes declare an
        structure pass it to call as needed on full of bytes and then call which
        will fill a supplied 16 byte with the digest
