This means installing Python (Python 3.6 or higher is required).\n\nSee `prerequisites <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#prerequisites>`_\nfor detailed information on the support platforms and Python versions.\n\nThere are a few common ways to `install ScanCode <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html>`_.\n\n- `*Recommended* installation as an application: Download a release archive, extract and run.\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-as-an-application-downloading-releases>`_\n\n- `Development installation from source code using a git clone\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-from-source-code-git-clone>`_\n\n- `Development installation as a library with \"pip install scancode-toolkit\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#pip-install>`_\n\n- `Run in a Docker container with a git clone and \"docker run\"\n  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-via-docker>`_\n\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nNote the `commands variation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#commands-variation>`_\nacross installation methods and platforms.\n\nYou can run an example scan printed on screen as JSON::\n\n    ./scancode -clip --json-pp - samples\n\nFollow the `How to Run a Scan <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html>`_\ntutorial to perform a basic scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed by\ndefault with Scancode.\n\nSee more command examples::\n\n    ./scancode --examples\n\nSee `How to select what will be detected in a scan\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_set_what_will_be_detected_in_a_scan.html>`_\nand `How to specify the output format <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_format_scan_output.html>`_\nfor more information.\n\nYou can also refer to the `command line options synopsis\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html>`_\nand an exhaustive list of `all available command line options\n<https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html>`_.\n\n\nArchive extraction\n==================\n\nBy default ScanCode does not extract files from tarballs, zip files, and\nother archives as part of the scan. The archives that exist in a codebase\nmust be extracted before running a scan: `extractcode` is a bundled utility\nbehaving as a mostly-universal archive extractor. For example, this command will\nrecursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract\ndirectory::\n\n    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2\n\nSee `all extractcode options <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html#all-extractcode-options>`_\nand `how to extract archives <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_extract_archives.html>`_ for details.\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues\n\nFor discussions and chats, we have:\n\n* an official Gitter channel for `web-based chats\n  <https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss>`_.\n  Gitter is also accessible via an `IRC bridge <https://irc.gitter.im/>`_.\n  There are other AboutCode project-specific channels available there too.\n\n* an official `#aboutcode` IRC channel on liberachat (server web.libera.chat).\n  This channel receives build and commit notifications and can be noisy.\n  You can use your favorite IRC client or use the `web chat \n  <https://web.libera.chat/?#aboutcode>`_.\n\n\nSource code and downloads\n=========================\n\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git\n* https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Apache-2.0 as the overall license\n* CC-BY-4.0 for reference datasets (initially was in the Public Domain).\n* Multiple other secondary permissive or copyleft licenses (LGPL, MIT,\n  BSD, GPL 2/3, etc.) for third-party components.\n\n\nSee the NOTICE file and the .ABOUT files that document the origin and license of\nthe third-party code used in ScanCode for more details.\n\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4webymu0l2ip8utr?svg=true\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/nexB/scancode-toolkit\n    :alt: Appveyor tests status (Windows)\n\n.. |azure| image:: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_apis/build/status/nexB.scancode-toolkit?branchName=develop\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop\n    :alt: Azure tests status (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n.. |docs-rtd| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scancode-toolkit/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status",

For example, this command will\nrecursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract\ndirectory::\n\n    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2\n\nSee `all extractcode options <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html#all-extractcode-options>`_\nand `how to extract archives <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_extract_archives.html>`_ for details.\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues\n\nFor discussions and chats, we have:\n\n* an official Gitter channel for `web-based chats\n  <https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss>`_.\n  Gitter is also accessible via an `IRC bridge <https://irc.gitter.im/>`_.\n  There are other AboutCode project-specific channels available there too.\n\n* an official `#aboutcode` IRC channel on liberachat (server web.libera.chat).\n  This channel receives build and commit notifications and can be noisy.\n  You can use your favorite IRC client or use the `web chat \n  <https://web.libera.chat/?#aboutcode>`_.\n\n\nSource code and downloads\n=========================\n\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git\n* https://pypi.org/project/scancode-toolkit/\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Apache-2.0 as the overall license\n* CC-BY-4.0 for reference datasets (initially was in the Public Domain).\n* Multiple other secondary permissive or copyleft licenses (LGPL, MIT,\n  BSD, GPL 2/3, etc.) for third-party components.\n\n\nSee the NOTICE file and the .ABOUT files that document the origin and license of\nthe third-party code used in ScanCode for more details.\n\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4webymu0l2ip8utr?svg=true\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/nexB/scancode-toolkit\n    :alt: Appveyor tests status (Windows)\n\n.. |azure| image:: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_apis/build/status/nexB.scancode-toolkit?branchName=develop\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop\n    :alt: Azure tests status (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n.. |docs-rtd| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scancode-toolkit/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status",
