    "description": "HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling, file post, and more.\nurllib3 is a powerful, *user-friendly* HTTP client for Python. Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import urllib3\n    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager()\n    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')\n    >>> r.status\n    200\n    >>> r.data\n    'User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n'\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nurllib3 can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_::\n\n    $ python -m pip install urllib3\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from `GitHub <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3>`_::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at `urllib3.readthedocs.io <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io>`_.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions.

(Issue #1009)\n\n\n1.18.1 (2016-10-27)\n-------------------\n\n* CVE-2016-9015. Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with\n  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This\n  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration\n  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting\n  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous\n  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which\n  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.\n\n  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure\n  and release. The master branch received the same fix in Pull #1010.\n\n\n1.18 (2016-09-26)\n-----------------\n\n* Fixed incorrect message for IncompleteRead exception.

(Issue #887)\n\n* Used URLFetch default timeout on AppEngine, rather than hardcoding our own.\n  (Issue #858)\n\n* Normalize the scheme and host in the URL parser (Issue #833)\n\n* ``HTTPResponse`` contains the last ``Retry`` object, which now also\n  contains retries history. (Issue #848)\n\n* Timeout can no longer be set as boolean, and must be greater than zero.\n  (Pull #924)\n\n* Removed pyasn1 and ndg-httpsclient from dependencies used for PyOpenSSL. We\n  now use cryptography and idna, both of which are already dependencies of\n  PyOpenSSL. (Pull #930)\n\n* Fixed infinite loop in ``stream`` when amt=None. (Issue #928)\n\n* Try to use the operating system's certificates when we are using an\n  ``SSLContext``. (Pull #941)\n\n* Updated cipher suite list to allow ChaCha20+Poly1305. AES-GCM is preferred to\n  ChaCha20, but ChaCha20 is then preferred to everything else. (Pull #947)\n\n* Updated cipher suite list to remove 3DES-based cipher suites. (Pull #958)\n\n* Removed the cipher suite fallback to allow HIGH ciphers. (Pull #958)\n\n* Implemented ``length_remaining`` to determine remaining content\n  to be read. (Pull #949)\n\n* Implemented ``enforce_content_length`` to enable exceptions when\n  incomplete data chunks are received. (Pull #949)\n\n* Dropped connection start, dropped connection reset, redirect, forced retry,\n  and new HTTPS connection log levels to DEBUG, from INFO. (Pull #967)\n\n\n1.16 (2016-06-11)\n-----------------\n\n* Disable IPv6 DNS when IPv6 connections are not possible. (Issue #840)\n\n* Provide ``key_fn_by_scheme`` pool keying mechanism that can be\n  overridden.

(Issue #830)\n\n* Cleaner exception chain in Python 3 for ``_make_request``.\n  (Issue #861)\n\n* Fixed installing ``urllib3[socks]`` extra. (Issue #864)\n\n* Fixed signature of ``ConnectionPool.close`` so it can actually safely be\n  called by subclasses. (Issue #873)\n\n* Retain ``release_conn`` state across retries. (Issues #651, #866)\n\n* Add customizable ``HTTPConnectionPool.ResponseCls``, which defaults to\n  ``HTTPResponse`` but can be replaced with a subclass.

(Issue #352)\n\n\n1.8 (2014-03-04)\n----------------\n\n* Improved url parsing in ``urllib3.util.parse_url`` (properly parse '@' in\n  username, and blank ports like 'hostname:').\n\n* New ``urllib3.connection`` module which contains all the HTTPConnection\n  objects.\n\n* Several ``urllib3.util.Timeout``-related fixes. Also changed constructor\n  signature to a more sensible order. [Backwards incompatible]\n  (Issues #252, #262, #263)\n\n* Use ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` if it's installed. (Issue #274)\n\n* Added ``.tell()`` method to ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` which\n  returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)\n\n* Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)\n\n* Expand default-port comparison in ``HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host``\n  to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an\n  HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)\n\n* Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.\n  (Issue #309)\n\n* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.\n  (Issue #310)\n\n* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests\n  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of\n  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)\n\n* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``\n  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)\n\n* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom\n  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.\n  (Issue #329, #333)\n\n* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)\n\n* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA\n  certificates on inject. (Issue #332)\n\n* Requests with ``retries=False`` will immediately raise any exceptions without\n  wrapping them in ``MaxRetryError``. (Issue #348)\n\n* Fixed open socket leak with SSL-related failures. (Issue #344, #348)\n\n\n1.7.1 (2013-09-25)\n------------------\n\n* Added granular timeout support with new ``urllib3.util.Timeout`` class.\n  (Issue #231)\n\n* Fixed Python 3.4 support. (Issue #238)\n\n\n1.7 (2013-08-14)\n----------------\n\n* More exceptions are now pickle-able, with tests. (Issue #174)\n\n* Fixed redirecting with relative URLs in Location header. (Issue #178)\n\n* Support for relative urls in ``Location: ...`` header. (Issue #179)\n\n* ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` now inherits from ``io.IOBase`` for bonus\n  file-like functionality. (Issue #187)\n\n* Passing ``assert_hostname=False`` when creating a HTTPSConnectionPool will\n  skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)\n\n* New method ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.stream(...)`` which acts as a\n  generator wrapped around ``.read(...)``. (Issue #198)\n\n* IPv6 url parsing enforces brackets around the hostname. (Issue #199)\n\n* Fixed thread race condition in\n  ``urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...)`` (Issue #204)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` requests now include non-default port in ``Host: ...``\n  header. (Issue #217)\n\n* Added HTTPS proxy support in ``ProxyManager``. (Issue #170 #139)\n\n* New ``RequestField`` object can be passed to the ``fields=...`` param which\n  can specify headers. (Issue #220)\n\n* Raise ``urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError`` when connecting to proxy fails.\n  (Issue #221)\n\n* Use international headers when posting file names. (Issue #119)\n\n* Improved IPv6 support. (Issue #203)\n\n\n1.6 (2013-04-25)\n----------------\n\n* Contrib: Optional SNI support for Py2 using PyOpenSSL. (Issue #156)\n\n* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.\n\n* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like\n  \"REQUIRED\" or \"NONE\". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like \"SSLv23\"\n  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.\n  (Issue #130)\n\n* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly\n  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)\n\n* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak\n  on some platforms. (Issue #133)\n\n* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+. (Issue #89)\n\n* Tests fixed to be compatible with Py26 again. (Issue #125)\n\n* Added ability to choose SSL version by passing an ``ssl.PROTOCOL_*`` constant\n  to the ``ssl_version`` parameter of ``HTTPSConnectionPool``. (Issue #109)\n\n* Allow an explicit content type to be specified when encoding file fields.\n  (Issue #126)\n\n* Exceptions are now pickleable, with tests. (Issue #101)\n\n* Fixed default headers not getting passed in some cases. (Issue #99)\n\n* Treat \"content-encoding\" header value as case-insensitive, per RFC 2616\n  Section 3.5. (Issue #110)\n\n* \"Connection Refused\" SocketErrors will get retried rather than raised.\n  (Issue #92)\n\n* Updated vendored ``six``, no longer overrides the global ``six`` module\n  namespace. (Issue #113)\n\n* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding\n  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it\n  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.\n  (Issue #149)\n\n* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters\n  that are not files. (Issue #111)\n\n* Pass `strict` param down to ``httplib.HTTPConnection``. (Issue #122)\n\n* Added mechanism to verify SSL certificates by fingerprint (md5, sha1) or\n  against an arbitrary hostname (when connecting by IP or for misconfigured\n  servers). (Issue #140)\n\n* Streaming decompression support. (Issue #159)\n\n\n1.5 (2012-08-02)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``urllib3.add_stderr_logger()`` for quickly enabling STDERR debug\n  logging in urllib3.\n\n* Native full URL parsing (including auth, path, query, fragment) available in\n  ``urllib3.util.parse_url(url)``.\n\n* Built-in redirect will switch method to 'GET' if status code is 303.\n  (Issue #11)\n\n* ``urllib3.PoolManager`` strips the scheme and host before sending the request\n  uri. (Issue #8)\n\n* New ``urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`` exception for when automatic decoding,\n  based on the Content-Type header, fails.\n\n* Fixed bug with pool depletion and leaking connections (Issue #76). Added\n  explicit connection closing on pool eviction. Added\n  ``urllib3.PoolManager.clear()``.\n\n* 99% -> 100% unit test coverage.\n\n\n1.4 (2012-06-16)\n----------------\n\n* Minor AppEngine-related fixes.\n\n* Switched from ``mimetools.choose_boundary`` to ``uuid.uuid4()``.\n\n* Improved url parsing. (Issue #73)\n\n* IPv6 url support. (Issue #72)\n\n\n1.3 (2012-03-25)\n----------------\n\n* Removed pre-1.0 deprecated API.\n\n* Refactored helpers into a ``urllib3.util`` submodule.\n\n* Fixed multipart encoding to support list-of-tuples for keys with multiple\n  values. (Issue #48)\n\n* Fixed multiple Set-Cookie headers in response not getting merged properly in\n  Python 3. (Issue #53)\n\n* AppEngine support with Py27. (Issue #61)\n\n* Minor ``encode_multipart_formdata`` fixes related to Python 3 strings vs\n  bytes.\n\n\n1.2.2 (2012-02-06)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed packaging bug of not shipping ``test-requirements.txt``. (Issue #47)\n\n\n1.2.1 (2012-02-05)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed another bug related to when ``ssl`` module is not available. (Issue #41)\n\n* Location parsing errors now raise ``urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError``\n  which inherits from ``ValueError``.\n\n\n1.2 (2012-01-29)\n----------------\n\n* Added Python 3 support (tested on 3.2.2)\n\n* Dropped Python 2.5 support (tested on 2.6.7, 2.7.2)\n\n* Use ``select.poll`` instead of ``select.select`` for platforms that support\n  it.\n\n* Use ``Queue.LifoQueue`` instead of ``Queue.Queue`` for more aggressive\n  connection reusing. Configurable by overriding ``ConnectionPool.QueueCls``.\n\n* Fixed ``ImportError`` during install when ``ssl`` module is not available.\n  (Issue #41)\n\n* Fixed ``PoolManager`` redirects between schemes (such as HTTP -> HTTPS) not\n  completing properly. (Issue #28, uncovered by Issue #10 in v1.1)\n\n* Ported ``dummyserver`` to use ``tornado`` instead of ``webob`` +\n  ``eventlet``. Removed extraneous unsupported dummyserver testing backends.\n  Added socket-level tests.\n\n* More tests. Achievement Unlocked: 99% Coverage.\n\n\n1.1 (2012-01-07)\n----------------\n\n* Refactored ``dummyserver`` to its own root namespace module (used for\n  testing).\n\n* Added hostname verification for ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` by vendoring in\n  Py32's ``ssl_match_hostname``. (Issue #25)\n\n* Fixed cross-host HTTP redirects when using ``PoolManager``. (Issue #10)\n\n* Fixed ``decode_content`` being ignored when set through ``urlopen``. (Issue\n  #27)\n\n* Fixed timeout-related bugs. (Issues #17, #23)\n\n\n1.0.2 (2011-11-04)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed typo in ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` which would only present as a bug if\n  you're using the object manually. (Thanks pyos)\n\n* Made RecentlyUsedContainer (and consequently PoolManager) more thread-safe by\n  wrapping the access log in a mutex. (Thanks @christer)\n\n* Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and\n  ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.\n\n\n1.0.1 (2011-10-10)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,\n  causing extraneous \"HttpConnectionPool is full\" log warnings.\n\n\n1.0 (2011-10-08)\n----------------\n\n* Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and\n  documented).\n* Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works\n  with HTTPS proxies).\n* Added optional partial-read support for responses when\n  ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers\n  without loading the content.\n* Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).\n* Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.\n* Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``. Old\n  helpers like ``get_url`` and ``post_url`` should be abandoned in favour of\n  the new ``request(method, url, ...)``.\n* Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.\n* License header added to ``.py`` files.\n* Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code\n  and docs in ``docs/`` and on https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/.\n* Embettered all the things!\n* Started writing this file.\n\n\n0.4.1 (2011-07-17)\n------------------\n\n* Minor bug fixes, code cleanup.\n\n\n0.4 (2011-03-01)\n----------------\n\n* Better unicode support.\n* Added ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection``.\n* Added ``NTLMConnectionPool`` in contrib.\n* Minor improvements.\n\n\n0.3.1 (2010-07-13)\n------------------\n\n* Added ``assert_host_name`` optional parameter. Now compatible with proxies.\n\n\n0.3 (2009-12-10)\n----------------\n\n* Added HTTPS support.\n* Minor bug fixes.\n* Refactored, broken backwards compatibility with 0.2.\n* API to be treated as stable from this version forward.\n\n\n0.2 (2008-11-17)\n----------------\n\n* Added unit tests.\n* Bug fixes.\n\n\n0.1 (2008-11-16)\n----------------\n\n* First release.",
