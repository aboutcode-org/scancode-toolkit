About Samba
===========

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of
programs for Linux and Unix.
Samba is Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public License and
the Samba project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy.
Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS
and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.
Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix Servers and
Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can function both as a
domain controller or as a regular domain member.
