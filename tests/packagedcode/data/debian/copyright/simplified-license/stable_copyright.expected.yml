      This imagemap module started as a port of the original imagemap.c
      written by Rob McCool (11/13/93 robm@ncsa.uiuc.edu).
      This version includes the mapping algorithms found in version 1.3
      of imagemap.c.

      Contributors to this code include:

      Kevin Hughes, kevinh@pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu

      Eric Haines, erich@eye.com
      "macmartinized" polygon code copyright 1992 by Eric Haines, erich@eye.com

      Randy Terbush, randy@zyzzyva.com
      port to Apache module format, "base_uri" and support for relative URLs

      James H. Cloos, Jr., cloos@jhcloos.com
      Added point datatype, using code in NCSA's version 1.8 imagemap.c
      program, as distributed with version 1.4.1 of their server.
      The point code is originally added by Craig Milo Rogers, Rogers@ISI.Edu

      Nathan Kurz, nate@tripod.com
      Rewrite/reorganization.  New handling of default, base and relative URLs.
      New Configuration directives:
         ImapMenu {none, formatted, semiformatted, unformatted}
         ImapDefault {error, nocontent, referer, menu, URL}
         ImapBase {map, referer, URL}
      Support for creating non-graphical menu added.  (backwards compatible):
         Old:  directive URL [x,y ...]
         New:  directive URL "Menu text" [x,y ...]
          or:  directive URL x,y ... "Menu text"
      Map format and menu concept courtesy Joshua Bell, jsbell@acs.ucalgary.ca.

      Mark Cox, mark@ukweb.com, Allow relative URLs even when no base specified

      As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
        part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
        parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
        as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
        the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
        special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
        Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
        License without this special exception.
        .
        This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
        version 2.2 of Bison.  */
