          Agilio(r) Firmware License Agreement (the "AGREEMENT")

          BY INSTALLING OR USING IN ANY MANNER THE SOFTWARE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS
          AGREEMENT (THE "SOFTWARE") YOU (THE "LICENSEE") ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE BOUND
          BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

          LICENSE GRANT. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
          Netronome Systems, Inc. ("NETRONOME") hereby grants LICENSEE a non-
          exclusive license to use, reproduce and distribute the SOFTWARE
          exclusively in object form.

          Restrictions. LICENSEE agrees that, (a) unless explicitly provided by
          NETRONOME, the source code of the SOFTWARE is not being provided to
          LICENSEE and is confidential and proprietary to NETRONOME and that
          LICENSEE has no right to access or use such source code. Accordingly,
          LICENSEE agrees that it shall not cause or permit the disassembly,
          decompilation or reverse engineering of the SOFTWARE or otherwise attempt
          to gain access to the source code for the SOFTWARE; and (b) LICENSEE
          agrees that it shall not subject the SOFTWARE in whole or in part, to the
          terms of any software license that requires, as a condition of use,
          modification and/or distribution that the source code of the SOFTWARE, or
          the SOFTWARE be i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; ii)
          licensed for the purpose of making derivative works of the source code of
          the SOFTWARE; or iii) redistribution of the source code of the SOFTWARE
          at no charge.

          DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITH
          ALL FAULTS AND NETRONOME AND ITS LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
          SHALL NETRONOME OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION,
          OR DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE
          OF THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR EQUIPMENT, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL,
          INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE OR OTHER
          DAMAGES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE EVEN IF
          NETRONOME OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
          SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
          LIMITED REMEDY.

          EXPORT COMPLIANCE. LICENSEE shall not use or export or transmit the
          SOFTWARE, directly or indirectly, to any restricted countries or in any
          other manner that would violate any applicable US and other export
          control and other regulations and laws as shall from time to time govern
          the delivery, license and use of technology, including without limitation
          the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, and any regulations
          issued thereunder.

          PROHIBITION OF SOFTWARE USE IN HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES AND LIFE
          SUPPORT APPLICATIONS. The SOFTWARE is not designed, manufactured or
          intended for use as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments
          requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear
          facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems, air traffic
          control, life support systems, human implantation or any other
          application where product failure could lead to loss of life or
          catastrophic property damage or weapons systems, in which the failure of
          the SOFTWARE could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe
          physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly
          NETRONOME and, where applicable, NETRONOME'S third party licensors
          specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High
          Risk Activities.
