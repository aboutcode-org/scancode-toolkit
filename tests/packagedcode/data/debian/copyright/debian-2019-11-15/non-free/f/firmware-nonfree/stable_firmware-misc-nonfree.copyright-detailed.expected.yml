          IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
          NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
          the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
          downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
          printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
          or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
          of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,
          do not download the SOFTWARE.

          RECITALS

          Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
          hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
          laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
          property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
          patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
          in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
          patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
          it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
          agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.

          1.  DEFINITIONS

          1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
          downloads or otherwise obtains the SOFTWARE.

          2.  GRANT OF LICENSE

          2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
          the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
          SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:

          2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
          SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
          and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
          use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
          by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
          and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).

          2.1.2  Open Source Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms
          of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE may be copied and redistributed solely for
          use on operating systems distributed under the terms of an OSI-approved
          open source license as listed by the Open Source Initiative at
          http://opensource.org, provided that the binary files thereof are not
          modified, and Customer provides a copy of this license with the SOFTWARE.

          2.1.3  Limitations.

          No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
          decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
          manner to obtain the source code.

          Usage. SOFTWARE is licensed only for use with microprocessor(s) which have
          been (i) designed by NVIDIA and (ii) either (a) sold by or (b) licensed by
          NVIDIA. Customer shall not use SOFTWARE in conjunction with, nor cause
          SOFTWARE to be executed by, any other microprocessor.

          No Translation. Customer shall not translate SOFTWARE, nor cause or permit
          SOFTWARE to be translated, from the architecture or language in which it is
          originally provided by NVIDIA, into any other architecture or language.

          No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
          else.

          3.  TERMINATION

          This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
          comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
          Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
          component parts.

          Defensive Suspension.  If Customer commences or participates in any legal
          proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
          suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided
          under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.

          4.  COPYRIGHT

          All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
          not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
          music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
          the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
          are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
          by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
          Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
          material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
          and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
          archive purposes.

          5.  APPLICABLE LAW

          This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
          construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.

          6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

          6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
          LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
          DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
          EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR
          ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
          DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
          OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT
          OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS
          BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          7.  MISCELLANEOUS

          The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
          Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
          LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
          the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
          necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
          This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
          the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
          all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
          to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
          that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
          country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
          United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
          restrictions or regulations.  This LICENSE may only be modified in
          writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.
