          GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          Version 3, 19 November 2007

          Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
          verbatim copies of this license document,
          but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

          The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
          for software and other kinds of works,
          specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community
          in the case of network server software.

          The licenses for most software and other practical works
          are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
          By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended
          to guarantee your freedom to share
          and change all versions of a program--
          to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

          When we speak of free software,
          we are referring to freedom, not price.
          Our General Public Licenses are designed
          to make sure that you have the freedom
          to distribute copies of free software
          (and charge for them if you wish),
          that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
          that you can change the software
          or use pieces of it in new free programs,
          and that you know you can do these things.

          Developers that use our General Public Licenses
          protect your rights with two steps:
          (1) assert copyright on the software,
          and (2) offer you this License
          which gives you legal permission
          to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

          A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is
          that improvements made in alternate versions of the program,
          if they receive widespread use,
          become available for other developers to incorporate.
          Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged
          by the resulting cooperation.
          However, in the case of software used on network servers,
          this result may fail to come about.
          The GNU General Public License permits
          making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server
          without ever releasing its source code to the public.

          The GNU Affero General Public License is designed
          specifically to ensure that, in such cases,
          the modified source code becomes available to the community.
          It requires the operator of a network server to provide
          the source code of the modified version running there
          to the users of that server.
          Therefore, public use of a modified version,
          on a publicly accessible server,
          gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

          An older license,
          called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero,
          was designed to accomplish similar goals.
          This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL,
          but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL
          which permits relicensing under this license.

          The precise terms and conditions
          for copying, distribution and modification follow.

          TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          0. Definitions.

          "This License" refers to version 3
          of the GNU Affero General Public License.

          "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply
          to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

          "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work
          licensed under this License.
          Each licensee is addressed as "you".
          "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

          To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
          in a fashion requiring copyright permission,
          other than the making of an exact copy.
          The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
          or a work "based on" the earlier work.

          A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program
          or a work based on the Program.

          To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it
          that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable
          for infringement under applicable copyright law,
          except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
          Propagation includes copying,
          distribution (with or without modification),
          making available to the public,
          and in some countries other activities as well.

          To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation
          that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
          Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
          with no transfer of a copy,
          is not conveying.

          An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
          to the extent that it includes
          a convenient and prominently visible feature
          that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,
          and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work
          (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
          that licensees may convey the work under this License,
          and how to view a copy of this License.
          If the interface presents
          a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,
          a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

          1. Source Code.

          The "source code" for a work means
          the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
          "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

          A "Standard Interface" means
          an interface that either is an official standard
          defined by a recognized standards body,
          or, in the case of interfaces
          specified for a particular programming language,
          one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

          The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
          other than the work as a whole,
          that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
          but which is not part of that Major Component,
          and (b) serves only
          to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
          or to implement a Standard Interface
          for which an implementation is available to the public
          in source code form.
          A "Major Component", in this context, means
          a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)
          of the specific operating system (if any)
          on which the executable work runs,
          or a compiler used to produce the work,
          or an object code interpreter used to run it.

          The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means
          all the source code needed to generate, install,
          and (for an executable work) run the object code
          and to modify the work,
          including scripts to control those activities.
          However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
          or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
          which are used unmodified in performing those activities
          but which are not part of the work.
          For example, Corresponding Source includes
          interface definition files associated with source files for the work,
          and the source code for shared libraries
          and dynamically linked subprograms
          that the work is specifically designed to require,
          such as by intimate data communication or control flow
          between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

          The Corresponding Source need not include
          anything that users can regenerate automatically
          from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form
          is that same work.

          2. Basic Permissions.

          All rights granted under this License are granted
          for the term of copyright on the Program,
          and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
          This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission
          to run the unmodified Program.
          The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
          only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
          This License acknowledges your rights of fair use
          or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

          You may make, run and propagate
          covered works that you do not convey,
          without conditions
          so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
          You may convey covered works to others
          for the sole purpose of having them
          make modifications exclusively for you,
          or provide you with facilities for running those works,
          provided that you comply with the terms of this License
          in conveying all material
          for which you do not control copyright.
          Those thus making or running the covered works for you
          must do so exclusively on your behalf,
          under your direction and control,
          on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
          of your copyrighted material
          outside their relationship with you.

          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
          solely under the conditions stated below.
          Sublicensing is not allowed;
          section 10 makes it unnecessary.

          3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

          No covered work shall be deemed
          part of an effective technological measure
          under any applicable law fulfilling obligations
          under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
          adopted on 20 December 1996,
          or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
          circumvention of such measures.

          When you convey a covered work,
          you waive any legal power
          to forbid circumvention of technological measures
          to the extent such circumvention is effected
          by exercising rights under this License
          with respect to the covered work,
          and you disclaim any intention
          to limit operation or modification of the work
          as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,
          your or third parties' legal rights
          to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code
          as you receive it, in any medium,
          provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
          on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
          keep intact all notices
          stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
          added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
          keep intact all notices
          of the absence of any warranty;
          and give all recipients a copy of this License
          along with the Program.

          You may charge any price or no price
          for each copy that you convey,
          and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

          5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

          You may convey a work based on the Program,
          or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
          in the form of source code
          under the terms of section 4,
          provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          a) The work must carry prominent notices
          stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

          b) The work must carry prominent notices
          stating that it is released under this License
          and any conditions added under section 7.
          This requirement modifies
          the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

          c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
          to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
          This License will therefore apply,
          along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
          to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
          regardless of how they are packaged.
          This License gives no permission
          to license the work in any other way,
          but it does not invalidate such permission
          if you have separately received it.

          d) If the work has interactive user interfaces,
          each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
          however, if the Program has interactive interfaces
          that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,
          your work need not make them do so.

          A compilation of a covered work
          with other separate and independent works,
          which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
          and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
          in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
          is called an "aggregate"
          if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
          to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
          beyond what the individual works permit.
          Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate
          does not cause this License to apply
          to the other parts of the aggregate.

          6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

          You may convey a covered work in object code form
          under the terms of sections 4 and 5,
          provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
          under the terms of this License,
          in one of these ways:

          a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium),
          accompanied by the Corresponding Source
          fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

          b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium),
          accompanied by a written offer,
          valid for at least three years
          and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support
          for that product model,
          to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
          for all the software in the product that is covered by this License,
          on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange,
          for a price no more than your reasonable cost
          of physically performing this conveying of source,
          or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source
          from a network server at no charge.

          c) Convey individual copies of the object code
          with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
          This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

          d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
          (gratis or for a charge),
          and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
          in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
          You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source
          along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
          the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
          (operated by you or a third party)
          that supports equivalent copying facilities,
          provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code
          saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,
          you remain obligated to ensure that it is available
          for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

          e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers
          where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
          are being offered to the general public
          at no charge under subsection 6d.

          A separable portion of the object code,
          whose source code is excluded
          from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
          need not be included in conveying the object code work.

          A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product",
          which means any tangible personal property
          which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes,
          or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
          In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
          doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
          For a particular product received by a particular user,
          "normally used" refers to a typical or common use
          of that class of product,
          regardless of the status of the particular user
          or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
          or expects or is expected to use,
          the product.
          A product is a consumer product
          regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
          industrial or non-consumer uses,
          unless such uses represent the only significant mode
          of use of the product.

          "Installation Information" for a User Product means
          any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
          required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
          in that User Product
          from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
          The information must suffice to ensure
          that the continued functioning of the modified object code
          is in no case prevented or interfered with
          solely because modification has been made.

          If you convey an object code work under this section
          in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,
          and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction
          in which the right of possession and use of the User Product
          is transferred to the recipient
          in perpetuity or for a fixed term
          (regardless of how the transaction is characterized),
          the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must
          be accompanied by the Installation Information.
          But this requirement does not apply
          if neither you nor any third party retains
          the ability to install modified object code on the User Product
          (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
          a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty,
          or updates for a work
          that has been modified or installed by the recipient,
          or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.
          Access to a network may be denied
          when the modification itself materially and adversely affects
          the operation of the network
          or violates the rules and protocols
          for communication across the network.

          Corresponding Source conveyed,
          and Installation Information provided,
          in accord with this section must be in a format
          that is publicly documented
          (and with an implementation available to the public
          in source code form),
          and must require no special password or key
          for unpacking, reading or copying.

          7. Additional Terms.

          "Additional permissions" are terms
          that supplement the terms of this License
          by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
          shall be treated as though they were included in this License,
          to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
          If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
          that part may be used separately under those permissions,
          but the entire Program remains governed by this License
          without regard to the additional permissions.

          When you convey a copy of a covered work,
          you may at your option remove any additional permissions
          from that copy, or from any part of it.
          (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
          in certain cases when you modify the work.)
          You may place additional permissions on material,
          added by you to a covered work,
          for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
          for material you add to a covered work, you may
          (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
          supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
          differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          b) Requiring preservation
          of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material
          or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
          displayed by works containing it; or

          c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes
          of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

          e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law
          for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          f) Requiring indemnification
          of licensors and authors of that material
          by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
          with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
          for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose
          on those licensors and authors.

          All other non-permissive additional terms
          are considered "further restrictions"
          within the meaning of section 10.
          If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
          contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License
          along with a term that is a further restriction,
          you may remove that term.
          If a license document contains a further restriction
          but permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
          you may add to a covered work material governed
          by the terms of that license document,
          provided that the further restriction does not survive
          such relicensing or conveying.

          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,
          you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement
          of the additional terms that apply to those files,
          or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated
          in the form of a separately written license,
          or stated as exceptions;
          the above requirements apply either way.

          8. Termination.

          You may not propagate or modify a covered work
          except as expressly provided under this License.
          Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
          and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
          (including any patent licenses granted
          under the third paragraph of section 11).

          However, if you cease all violation of this License,
          then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
          (a) provisionally,
          unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
          terminates your license,
          and (b) permanently,
          if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation
          by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder
          is reinstated permanently
          if the copyright holder notifies you
          of the violation by some reasonable means,
          this is the first time you have received notice
          of violation of this License (for any work)
          from that copyright holder,
          and you cure the violation
          prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
          the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights
          from you under this License.
          If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
          you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material
          under section 10.

          9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

          You are not required to accept this License
          in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.
          Ancillary propagation
          of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
          of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
          likewise does not require acceptance.
          However, nothing other than this License grants you
          permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
          These actions infringe copyright
          if you do not accept this License.
          Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
          you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

          10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

          Each time you convey a covered work,
          the recipient automatically receives
          a license from the original licensors,
          to run, modify and propagate that work,
          subject to this License.
          You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
          with this License.

          An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control
          of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,
          or subdividing an organization,
          or merging organizations.
          If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,
          each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work
          also receives whatever licenses to the work
          the party's predecessor in interest had or could give
          under the previous paragraph,
          plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
          from the predecessor in interest,
          if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

          You may not impose any further restrictions
          on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.
          For example, you may not impose
          a license fee, royalty, or other charge
          for exercise of rights granted under this License,
          and you may not initiate litigation
          (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
          alleging that any patent claim is infringed
          by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
          the Program or any portion of it.

          11. Patents.

          A "contributor" is a copyright holder
          who authorizes use under this License of the Program
          or a work on which the Program is based.
          The work thus licensed is called
          the contributor's "contributor version".

          A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
          owned or controlled by the contributor,
          whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
          that would be infringed by some manner,
          permitted by this License,
          of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
          but do not include claims
          that would be infringed only as a consequence
          of further modification of the contributor version.
          For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right
          to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
          consistent with the requirements of this License.

          Each contributor grants you
          a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
          under the contributor's essential patent claims,
          to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify
          and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

          In the following three paragraphs,
          a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment,
          however denominated, not to enforce a patent
          (such as an express permission to practice a patent
          or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
          To "grant" such a patent license to a party means
          to make such an agreement or commitment
          not to enforce a patent against the party.

          If you convey a covered work,
          knowingly relying on a patent license,
          and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
          for anyone to copy,
          free of charge and under the terms of this License,
          through a publicly available network server
          or other readily accessible means,
          then you must either
          (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
          or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
          of the patent license for this particular work,
          or (3) arrange,
          in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
          to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
          "Knowingly relying" means
          you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,
          your conveying the covered work in a country,
          or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,
          would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country
          that you have reason to believe are valid.

          If, pursuant to or in connection
          with a single transaction or arrangement,
          you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work,
          and grant a patent license to some of the parties
          receiving the covered work authorizing them
          to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
          then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
          to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

          A patent license is "discriminatory"
          if it does not include within the scope of its coverage,
          prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
          the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
          that are specifically granted under this License.
          You may not convey a covered work
          if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party
          that is in the business of distributing software,
          under which you make payment to the third party
          based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,
          and under which the third party grants,
          to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you,
          a discriminatory patent license
          (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you
          (or copies made from those copies),
          or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products
          or compilations that contain the covered work,
          unless you entered into that arrangement,
          or that patent license was granted,
          prior to 28 March 2007.

          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
          any implied license or other defenses to infringement
          that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

          12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

          If conditions are imposed on you
          (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
          that contradict the conditions of this License,
          they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
          If you cannot convey a covered work
          so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
          under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
          then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
          For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
          to collect a royalty for further conveying from those
          to whom you convey the Program,
          the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
          would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

          13. Remote Network Interaction;
          Use with the GNU General Public License.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
          if you modify the Program,
          your modified version must prominently offer
          all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network
          (if your version supports such interaction)
          an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version
          by providing access to the Corresponding Source
          from a network server at no charge,
          through some standard or customary means
          of facilitating copying of software.
          This Corresponding Source shall include
          the Corresponding Source for any work covered
          by version 3 of the GNU General Public License
          that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
          you have permission to link or combine any covered work
          with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU General Public License
          into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.
          The terms of this License will continue to apply
          to the part which is the covered work,
          but the work with which it is combined will remain governed
          by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

          14. Revised Versions of this License.

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.
          Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
          If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version
          of the GNU Affero General Public License
          "or any later version" applies to it,
          you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that numbered version
          or of any later version
          published by the Free Software Foundation.
          If the Program does not specify a version number
          of the GNU Affero General Public License,
          you may choose any version ever
          published by the Free Software Foundation.

          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
          which future versions
          of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used,
          that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
          permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

          Later license versions may give you
          additional or different permissions.
          However, no additional obligations are imposed
          on any author or copyright holder
          as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

          15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
          TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
          EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
          THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
          WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
          THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
          AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
          THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
          IS WITH YOU.
          SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
          YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

          16. Limitation of Liability.

          IN NO EVENT
          UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
          WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
          BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
          (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
          LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
          OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
          OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
          EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
          OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

          If the disclaimer
          of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
          cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
          reviewing courts shall apply local law
          that most closely approximates an absolute waiver
          of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
          unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies
          a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

          If you develop a new program,
          and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,
          the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
          which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
          It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
          to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;
          and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
          and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

          <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
          Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

          This program is free software:
          you can redistribute it and/or modify it
          under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License
          as published by the Free Software Foundation,
          either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
          but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
          without even the implied warranty
          of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
          See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

          You should have received
          a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
          along with this program.
          If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

          Also add information on how to contact you
          by electronic and paper mail.

          If your software can interact with users
          remotely through a computer network,
          you should also make sure that it provides
          a way for users to get its source.
          For example, if your program is a web application,
          its interface could display a "Source" link
          that leads users to an archive of the code.
          There are many ways you could offer source,
          and different solutions will be better for different programs;
          see section 13 for the specific requirements.

          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
          or school, if any, to sign
          a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
          For more information on this,
          and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL,
          see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

          The FreeType Project LICENSE
          ----------------------------

          2006-Jan-27

          Copyright 1996-2002, 2006
          by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

          Introduction
          ============

          The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
          some of them may contain,
          in addition to the FreeType font engine,
          various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to,
          the FreeType Project.

          This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
          which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license
          affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
          documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

          This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
          (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion
          and use of free software in commercial and freeware products
          alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
           * We don't promise that this software works.
             However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports.
             ("as is" distribution)
           * You can use this software for whatever you want,
             in parts or full form,
             without having to pay us.
             ("royalty-free" usage)
           * You may not pretend that you wrote this software.
             If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program,
             you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation
             that you have used the FreeType code.
             ("credits")

          We specifically permit and encourage
          the inclusion of this software,
          with or without modifications,
          in commercial products.
          We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project
          and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

          Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form
          for a credit/disclaimer to use
          in compliance with this license.
          We thus encourage you to use the following text:

          """
          Portions of this software are
          copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).
          All rights reserved.
          """

          Please replace <year> with the value
          from the FreeType version you actually use.

          Legal Terms
          ===========

          0. Definitions
          --------------

          Throughout this license,
          the terms "package", "FreeType Project", and "FreeType archive"
          refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors
          (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg)
          as the "FreeType Project",
          be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

          "You" refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
          where "using" is a generic term
          including compiling the project's source code
          as well as linking it to form a "program" or "executable".
          This program is referred to as "a program using the FreeType engine".

          This license applies to all files
          distributed in the original FreeType Project,
          including all source code, binaries and documentation,
          unless otherwise stated in the file
          in its original, unmodified form
          as distributed in the original archive.
          If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered
          by this license,
          you must contact us to verify this.

          The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000
          by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.
          All rights reserved except as specified below.

          1. No Warranty
          --------------

          THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
          WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
          AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
          IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
          BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
          CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE,
          OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

          2. Redistribution
          -----------------

          This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free,
          perpetual and irrevocable right and license
          to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy,
          create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
          the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms)
          and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
          and to authorize others to exercise
          some or all of the rights granted herein,
          subject to the following conditions:
           * Redistribution of source code must retain
             this license file ("FTL.TXT") unaltered;
             any additions, deletions or changes to the original files
             must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
             The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files
             must be preserved in all copies of source files.
           * Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer
             that states that the software is based in part
             of the work of the FreeType Team,
             in the distribution documentation.
             We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page
             in your documentation,
             though this isn't mandatory.

          These conditions apply to any software
          derived from or based on the FreeType Project,
          not just the unmodified files.
          If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.
          However, no fee need be paid to us.

          3. Advertising
          --------------

          Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you
          shall use the name of the other
          for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
          without specific prior written permission.

          We suggest, but do not require,
          that you use one or more of the following phrases
          to refer to this software
          in your documentation or advertising materials:
          "FreeType Project", "FreeType Engine", "FreeType library",
          or "FreeType Distribution".

          As you have not signed this license,
          you are not required to accept it.
          However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material,
          only this license, or another one contracted with the authors,
          grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
          Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying
          the FreeType Project,
          you indicate that you understand
          and accept all the terms of this license.

          4. Contacts
          -----------

          There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
           * freetype@nongnu.org
             Discusses general use and applications of FreeType,
             as well as future and wanted additions
             to the library and distribution.
             If you are looking for support,
             start in this list
             if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
           * freetype-devel@nongnu.org
             Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,
             specific licenses, porting, etc.
