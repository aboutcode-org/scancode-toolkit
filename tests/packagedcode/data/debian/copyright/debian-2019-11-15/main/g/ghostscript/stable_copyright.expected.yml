      GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      Version 3, 19 November 2007

      Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
      verbatim copies of this license document,
      but changing it is not allowed.

      Preamble

      The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
      for software and other kinds of works,
      specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community
      in the case of network server software.

      The licenses for most software and other practical works
      are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
      By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended
      to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change all versions of a program--
      to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

      When we speak of free software,
      we are referring to freedom, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed
      to make sure that you have the freedom
      to distribute copies of free software
      (and charge for them if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
      that you can change the software
      or use pieces of it in new free programs,
      and that you know you can do these things.

      Developers that use our General Public Licenses
      protect your rights with two steps:
      (1) assert copyright on the software,
      and (2) offer you this License
      which gives you legal permission
      to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

      A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is
      that improvements made in alternate versions of the program,
      if they receive widespread use,
      become available for other developers to incorporate.
      Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged
      by the resulting cooperation.
      However, in the case of software used on network servers,
      this result may fail to come about.
      The GNU General Public License permits
      making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server
      without ever releasing its source code to the public.

      The GNU Affero General Public License is designed
      specifically to ensure that, in such cases,
      the modified source code becomes available to the community.
      It requires the operator of a network server to provide
      the source code of the modified version running there
      to the users of that server.
      Therefore, public use of a modified version,
      on a publicly accessible server,
      gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

      An older license,
      called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero,
      was designed to accomplish similar goals.
      This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL,
      but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL
      which permits relicensing under this license.

      The precise terms and conditions
      for copying, distribution and modification follow.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      0. Definitions.

      "This License" refers to version 3
      of the GNU Affero General Public License.

      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply
      to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work
      licensed under this License.
      Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
      in a fashion requiring copyright permission,
      other than the making of an exact copy.
      The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
      or a work "based on" the earlier work.

      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program
      or a work based on the Program.

      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it
      that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable
      for infringement under applicable copyright law,
      except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
      Propagation includes copying,
      distribution (with or without modification),
      making available to the public,
      and in some countries other activities as well.

      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation
      that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
      Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
      with no transfer of a copy,
      is not conveying.

      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
      to the extent that it includes
      a convenient and prominently visible feature
      that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,
      and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work
      (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
      that licensees may convey the work under this License,
      and how to view a copy of this License.
      If the interface presents
      a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,
      a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

      1. Source Code.

      The "source code" for a work means
      the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
      "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

      A "Standard Interface" means
      an interface that either is an official standard
      defined by a recognized standards body,
      or, in the case of interfaces
      specified for a particular programming language,
      one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
      other than the work as a whole,
      that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
      but which is not part of that Major Component,
      and (b) serves only
      to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
      or to implement a Standard Interface
      for which an implementation is available to the public
      in source code form.
      A "Major Component", in this context, means
      a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)
      of the specific operating system (if any)
      on which the executable work runs,
      or a compiler used to produce the work,
      or an object code interpreter used to run it.

      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means
      all the source code needed to generate, install,
      and (for an executable work) run the object code
      and to modify the work,
      including scripts to control those activities.
      However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
      or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
      which are used unmodified in performing those activities
      but which are not part of the work.
      For example, Corresponding Source includes
      interface definition files associated with source files for the work,
      and the source code for shared libraries
      and dynamically linked subprograms
      that the work is specifically designed to require,
      such as by intimate data communication or control flow
      between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

      The Corresponding Source need not include
      anything that users can regenerate automatically
      from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form
      is that same work.

      2. Basic Permissions.

      All rights granted under this License are granted
      for the term of copyright on the Program,
      and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
      This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission
      to run the unmodified Program.
      The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
      only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
      This License acknowledges your rights of fair use
      or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

      You may make, run and propagate
      covered works that you do not convey,
      without conditions
      so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
      You may convey covered works to others
      for the sole purpose of having them
      make modifications exclusively for you,
      or provide you with facilities for running those works,
      provided that you comply with the terms of this License
      in conveying all material
      for which you do not control copyright.
      Those thus making or running the covered works for you
      must do so exclusively on your behalf,
      under your direction and control,
      on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
      of your copyrighted material
      outside their relationship with you.

      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
      solely under the conditions stated below.
      Sublicensing is not allowed;
      section 10 makes it unnecessary.

      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

      No covered work shall be deemed
      part of an effective technological measure
      under any applicable law fulfilling obligations
      under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
      adopted on 20 December 1996,
      or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
      circumvention of such measures.

      When you convey a covered work,
      you waive any legal power
      to forbid circumvention of technological measures
      to the extent such circumvention is effected
      by exercising rights under this License
      with respect to the covered work,
      and you disclaim any intention
      to limit operation or modification of the work
      as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,
      your or third parties' legal rights
      to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code
      as you receive it, in any medium,
      provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
      on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
      keep intact all notices
      stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
      added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
      keep intact all notices
      of the absence of any warranty;
      and give all recipients a copy of this License
      along with the Program.

      You may charge any price or no price
      for each copy that you convey,
      and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

      You may convey a work based on the Program,
      or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
      in the form of source code
      under the terms of section 4,
      provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices
      stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices
      stating that it is released under this License
      and any conditions added under section 7.
      This requirement modifies
      the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
      to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
      This License will therefore apply,
      along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
      to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.
      This License gives no permission
      to license the work in any other way,
      but it does not invalidate such permission
      if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces,
      each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
      however, if the Program has interactive interfaces
      that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,
      your work need not make them do so.

      A compilation of a covered work
      with other separate and independent works,
      which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
      and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
      in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
      is called an "aggregate"
      if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
      to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
      beyond what the individual works permit.
      Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate
      does not cause this License to apply
      to the other parts of the aggregate.

      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

      You may convey a covered work in object code form
      under the terms of sections 4 and 5,
      provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
      under the terms of this License,
      in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium),
      accompanied by the Corresponding Source
      fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium),
      accompanied by a written offer,
      valid for at least three years
      and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support
      for that product model,
      to give anyone who possesses the object code
      either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License,
      on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange,
      for a price no more than your reasonable cost
      of physically performing this conveying of source,
      or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source
      from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code
      with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
      This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
      and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
      in accord with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge),
      and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
      in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
      You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source
      along with the object code.
      If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
      (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities,
      provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code
      saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
      Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,
      you remain obligated to ensure that it is available
      for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
      provided you inform other peers
      where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
      are being offered to the general public
      at no charge under subsection 6d.

      A separable portion of the object code,
      whose source code is excluded
      from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
      need not be included in conveying the object code work.

      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product",
      which means any tangible personal property
      which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes,
      or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
      In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
      doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
      For a particular product received by a particular user,
      "normally used" refers to a typical or common use
      of that class of product,
      regardless of the status of the particular user
      or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
      or expects or is expected to use,
      the product.
      A product is a consumer product
      regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
      industrial or non-consumer uses,
      unless such uses represent the only significant mode
      of use of the product.

      "Installation Information" for a User Product means
      any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
      required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
      in that User Product
      from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
      The information must suffice to ensure
      that the continued functioning of the modified object code
      is in no case prevented or interfered with
      solely because modification has been made.

      If you convey an object code work under this section
      in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,
      and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction
      in which the right of possession and use of the User Product
      is transferred to the recipient
      in perpetuity or for a fixed term
      (regardless of how the transaction is characterized),
      the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must
      be accompanied by the Installation Information.
      But this requirement does not apply
      if neither you nor any third party retains
      the ability to install modified object code on the User Product
      (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
      a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty,
      or updates for a work
      that has been modified or installed by the recipient,
      or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.
      Access to a network may be denied
      when the modification itself materially and adversely affects
      the operation of the network
      or violates the rules and protocols
      for communication across the network.

      Corresponding Source conveyed,
      and Installation Information provided,
      in accord with this section must be in a format
      that is publicly documented
      (and with an implementation available to the public
      in source code form),
      and must require no special password or key
      for unpacking, reading or copying.

      7. Additional Terms.

      "Additional permissions" are terms
      that supplement the terms of this License
      by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
      Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
      shall be treated as though they were included in this License,
      to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
      If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
      that part may be used separately under those permissions,
      but the entire Program remains governed by this License
      without regard to the additional permissions.

      When you convey a copy of a covered work,
      you may at your option remove any additional permissions
      from that copy, or from any part of it.
      (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
      in certain cases when you modify the work.)
      You may place additional permissions on material,
      added by you to a covered work,
      for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      for material you add to a covered work, you may
      (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
      supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
      differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation
      of specified reasonable legal notices
      or author attributions in that material
      or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
      or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
      in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes
      of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law
      for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification
      of licensors and authors of that material
      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
      with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
      for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose
      on those licensors and authors.

      All other non-permissive additional terms
      are considered "further restrictions"
      within the meaning of section 10.
      If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
      contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License
      along with a term that is a further restriction,
      you may remove that term.
      If a license document contains a further restriction
      but permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
      you may add to a covered work material governed
      by the terms of that license document,
      provided that the further restriction does not survive
      such relicensing or conveying.

      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,
      you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement
      of the additional terms that apply to those files,
      or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated
      in the form of a separately written license,
      or stated as exceptions;
      the above requirements apply either way.

      8. Termination.

      You may not propagate or modify a covered work
      except as expressly provided under this License.
      Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
      and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
      (including any patent licenses granted
      under the third paragraph of section 11).

      However, if you cease all violation of this License,
      then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
      (a) provisionally,
      unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
      terminates your license,
      and (b) permanently,
      if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation
      by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder
      is reinstated permanently
      if the copyright holder notifies you
      of the violation by some reasonable means,
      this is the first time you have received notice
      of violation of this License (for any work)
      from that copyright holder,
      and you cure the violation
      prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
      the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights
      from you under this License.
      If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
      you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material
      under section 10.

      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

      You are not required to accept this License
      in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.
      Ancillary propagation
      of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
      of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
      likewise does not require acceptance.
      However, nothing other than this License grants you
      permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
      These actions infringe copyright
      if you do not accept this License.
      Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
      you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

      Each time you convey a covered work,
      the recipient automatically receives
      a license from the original licensors,
      to run, modify and propagate that work,
      subject to this License.
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
      with this License.

      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control
      of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,
      or subdividing an organization,
      or merging organizations.
      If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,
      each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work
      also receives whatever licenses to the work
      the party's predecessor in interest had or could give
      under the previous paragraph,
      plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
      from the predecessor in interest,
      if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

      You may not impose any further restrictions
      on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.
      For example, you may not impose
      a license fee, royalty, or other charge
      for exercise of rights granted under this License,
      and you may not initiate litigation
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that any patent claim is infringed
      by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
      the Program or any portion of it.

      11. Patents.

      A "contributor" is a copyright holder
      who authorizes use under this License of the Program
      or a work on which the Program is based.
      The work thus licensed is called
      the contributor's "contributor version".

      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
      owned or controlled by the contributor,
      whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
      that would be infringed by some manner,
      permitted by this License,
      of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
      but do not include claims
      that would be infringed only as a consequence
      of further modification of the contributor version.
      For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right
      to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
      consistent with the requirements of this License.

      Each contributor grants you
      a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
      under the contributor's essential patent claims,
      to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify
      and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

      In the following three paragraphs,
      a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment,
      however denominated, not to enforce a patent
      (such as an express permission to practice a patent
      or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
      To "grant" such a patent license to a party means
      to make such an agreement or commitment
      not to enforce a patent against the party.

      If you convey a covered work,
      knowingly relying on a patent license,
      and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
      for anyone to copy,
      free of charge and under the terms of this License,
      through a publicly available network server
      or other readily accessible means,
      then you must either
      (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
      or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
      of the patent license for this particular work,
      or (3) arrange,
      in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
      to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
      "Knowingly relying" means
      you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,
      your conveying the covered work in a country,
      or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,
      would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country
      that you have reason to believe are valid.

      If, pursuant to or in connection
      with a single transaction or arrangement,
      you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work,
      and grant a patent license to some of the parties
      receiving the covered work authorizing them
      to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
      then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
      to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

      A patent license is "discriminatory"
      if it does not include within the scope of its coverage,
      prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
      the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
      that are specifically granted under this License.
      You may not convey a covered work
      if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party
      that is in the business of distributing software,
      under which you make payment to the third party
      based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,
      and under which the third party grants,
      to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you,
      a discriminatory patent license
      (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you
      (or copies made from those copies),
      or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products
      or compilations that contain the covered work,
      unless you entered into that arrangement,
      or that patent license was granted,
      prior to 28 March 2007.

      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
      any implied license or other defenses to infringement
      that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

      If conditions are imposed on you
      (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
      that contradict the conditions of this License,
      they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
      If you cannot convey a covered work
      so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
      under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
      then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
      For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
      to collect a royalty for further conveying from those
      to whom you convey the Program,
      the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
      would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

      13. Remote Network Interaction;
      Use with the GNU General Public License.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      if you modify the Program,
      your modified version must prominently offer
      all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network
      (if your version supports such interaction)
      an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version
      by providing access to the Corresponding Source
      from a network server at no charge,
      through some standard or customary means
      of facilitating copying of software.
      This Corresponding Source shall include
      the Corresponding Source for any work covered
      by version 3 of the GNU General Public License
      that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      you have permission to link or combine any covered work
      with a work licensed
      under version 3 of the GNU General Public License
      into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.
      The terms of this License will continue to apply
      to the part which is the covered work,
      but the work with which it is combined will remain governed
      by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

      14. Revised Versions of this License.

      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
      of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.
      Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
      but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
      If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version
      of the GNU Affero General Public License
      "or any later version" applies to it,
      you have the option of following the terms and conditions
      either of that numbered version
      or of any later version
      published by the Free Software Foundation.
      If the Program does not specify a version number
      of the GNU Affero General Public License,
      you may choose any version ever
      published by the Free Software Foundation.

      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
      which future versions
      of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used,
      that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
      permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

      Later license versions may give you
      additional or different permissions.
      However, no additional obligations are imposed
      on any author or copyright holder
      as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
      TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
      THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
      EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
      THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
      AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
      IS WITH YOU.
      SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
      YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      16. Limitation of Liability.

      IN NO EVENT
      UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
      WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
      BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
      (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
      LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
      OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
      OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
      EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
      OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

      If the disclaimer
      of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
      cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
      reviewing courts shall apply local law
      that most closely approximates an absolute waiver
      of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
      unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies
      a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program,
      and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,
      the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
      which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
      It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
      to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;
      and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
      and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software:
      you can redistribute it and/or modify it
      under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License
      as published by the Free Software Foundation,
      either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
      without even the implied warranty
      of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

      You should have received
      a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
      along with this program.
      If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

      Also add information on how to contact you
      by electronic and paper mail.

      If your software can interact with users
      remotely through a computer network,
      you should also make sure that it provides
      a way for users to get its source.
      For example, if your program is a web application,
      its interface could display a "Source" link
      that leads users to an archive of the code.
      There are many ways you could offer source,
      and different solutions will be better for different programs;
      see section 13 for the specific requirements.

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
      or school, if any, to sign
      a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
      For more information on this,
      and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL,

      The FreeType Project LICENSE
      ----------------------------

      2006-Jan-27

      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006
      by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

      Introduction
      ============

      The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
      some of them may contain,
      in addition to the FreeType font engine,
      various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to,
      the FreeType Project.

      This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
      which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license
      affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
      documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

      This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
      (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion
      and use of free software in commercial and freeware products
      alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
       * We don't promise that this software works.
         However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports.
         ("as is" distribution)
       * You can use this software for whatever you want,
         in parts or full form,
         without having to pay us.
         ("royalty-free" usage)
       * You may not pretend that you wrote this software.
         If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program,
         you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation
         that you have used the FreeType code.
         ("credits")

      We specifically permit and encourage
      the inclusion of this software,
      with or without modifications,
      in commercial products.
      We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project
      and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

      Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form
      for a credit/disclaimer to use
      in compliance with this license.
      We thus encourage you to use the following text:

      """
      Portions of this software are
      copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).
      All rights reserved.
      """

      Please replace <year> with the value
      from the FreeType version you actually use.

      Legal Terms
      ===========

      0. Definitions
      --------------

      Throughout this license,
      the terms "package", "FreeType Project", and "FreeType archive"
      refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors
      (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg)
      as the "FreeType Project",
      be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

      "You" refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
      where "using" is a generic term
      including compiling the project's source code
      as well as linking it to form a "program" or "executable".
      This program is referred to as "a program using the FreeType engine".

      This license applies to all files
      distributed in the original FreeType Project,
      including all source code, binaries and documentation,
      unless otherwise stated in the file
      in its original, unmodified form
      as distributed in the original archive.
      If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered
      by this license,
      you must contact us to verify this.

      The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000
      by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.
      All rights reserved except as specified below.

      1. No Warranty
      --------------

      THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
      EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
      AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
      BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
      CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE,
      OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

      2. Redistribution
      -----------------

      This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free,
      perpetual and irrevocable right and license
      to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy,
      create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
      the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms)
      and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
      and to authorize others to exercise
      some or all of the rights granted herein,
      subject to the following conditions:
       * Redistribution of source code must retain
         this license file ("FTL.TXT") unaltered;
         any additions, deletions or changes to the original files
         must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
         The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files
         must be preserved in all copies of source files.
       * Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer
         that states that the software is based in part
         of the work of the FreeType Team,
         in the distribution documentation.
         We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page
         in your documentation,
         though this isn't mandatory.

      These conditions apply to any software
      derived from or based on the FreeType Project,
      not just the unmodified files.
      If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.
      However, no fee need be paid to us.

      3. Advertising
      --------------

      Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you
      shall use the name of the other
      for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
      without specific prior written permission.

      We suggest, but do not require,
      that you use one or more of the following phrases
      to refer to this software
      in your documentation or advertising materials:
      "FreeType Project", "FreeType Engine", "FreeType library",
      or "FreeType Distribution".

      As you have not signed this license,
      you are not required to accept it.
      However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material,
      only this license, or another one contracted with the authors,
      grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
      Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying
      the FreeType Project,
      you indicate that you understand
      and accept all the terms of this license.

      4. Contacts
      -----------

      There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
       * freetype@nongnu.org
         Discusses general use and applications of FreeType,
         as well as future and wanted additions
         to the library and distribution.
         If you are looking for support,
         start in this list
         if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
       * freetype-devel@nongnu.org
         Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,
         specific licenses, porting, etc.
