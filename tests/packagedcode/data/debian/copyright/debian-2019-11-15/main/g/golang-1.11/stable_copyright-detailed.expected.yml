          THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
          CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
          PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
          WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
          PROHIBITED.

          BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
          AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
          LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
          THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

          1. Definitions

            a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
               and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
               derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
               literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
               includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
               the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
               form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
               that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
               Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
               doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
               phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
               with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
               Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

            b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
               such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
               phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
               than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
               selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
               intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
               entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
               contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
               in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
               whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
               considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
               this License.

            c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
               and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
               sale or other transfer of ownership.

            d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
               that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

            e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
               work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
               created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
               identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
               performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
               persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
               otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
               folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
               person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
               performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
               broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

            f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
               terms of this License including without limitation any
               production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
               whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
               digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
               lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
               dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
               entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
               without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
               works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
               of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
               lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
               expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
               applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
               three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
               architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
               phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
               as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
               circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
               literary or artistic work.

            g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
               License who has not previously violated the terms of this
               License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
               permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
               License despite a previous violation.

            h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
               Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
               by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
               public digital performances; to make available to the public
               Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
               Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
               to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and
               the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
               including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
               rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
               images.

            i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
               including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
               the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
               including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
               digital form or other electronic medium.

          2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
          reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
          arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
          connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
          applicable laws.

          3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
          Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
          perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
          exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

            a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
               Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
               Collections;

            b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
               Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
               reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
               identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
               example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
               translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
               indicate "The original work has been modified.";

            c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
               incorporated in Collections; and,

            d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

            e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
          jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
          through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
          be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
          collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
                    rights granted under this License;

                ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
          in which the right to collect royalties through any
          statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
          Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
          royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
                    under this License; and,

               iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
          collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
          that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
          administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
          from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
                    License.

          The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
          now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
          make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
          rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
          rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

          4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
          made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

            a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
               terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
               Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
               copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
               offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
               this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
               exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
               the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
               intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
               disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
               Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
               Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
               measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
               the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
               recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
               applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
               does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
               made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
               Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
               extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
               required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
               Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
               extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
               required by Section 4(b), as requested.

            b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
               Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
               made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
               are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
               pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
               Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
               a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
               ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
               service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
               parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
               extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
               specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
               not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
               the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
               of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
               the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
               Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
               Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may
               be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
               in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
               credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
               the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
               credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
               the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
               may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
               of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
               Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
               explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
               endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
               Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
               the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
               Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

            c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
               be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
               Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
               part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
               mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
               the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
               honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
               (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
               Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
               would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
               other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
               honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
               appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
               the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
               exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
               make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

          5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

          UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
          LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
          WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
          STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
          TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
          NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
          OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
          SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
          LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
          EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
          EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          7. Termination

            a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
               automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
               License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
               or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
               have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
               entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
               Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
               this License.

            b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
               here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
               in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
               right to release the Work under different license terms or to
               stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
               any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
               any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
               under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
               in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

          8. Miscellaneous

            a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
               Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
               the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
               to You under this License.

            b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
               Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
               on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
               under this License.

            c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
               under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
               enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
               and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
               such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
               to make such provision valid and enforceable.

            d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
               no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
               writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
               or consent.

            e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
               parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
               understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
               the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
               additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
               You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
               agreement of the Licensor and You.

            f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
               this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
               Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
               amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
               WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
               Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
               (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
               take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
               terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
               provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
               the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
               granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
               rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
               are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
               intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
