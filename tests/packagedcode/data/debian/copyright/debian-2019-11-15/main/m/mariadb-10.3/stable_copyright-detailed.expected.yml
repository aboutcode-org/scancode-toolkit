          The "Artistic License"

          Preamble

          The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
          Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
          semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
          while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
          the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
          reasonable modifications.

          Definitions:

          "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
          Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
          created through textual modification.

          "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
          modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
          of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

          "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
          copyrights for the package.

          "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
          this Package.

          "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
          basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
          and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
          Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
          as a market that must bear the fee.)

          "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
          itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
          It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
          under the same conditions they received it.

          1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
          Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
          duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

          2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
          derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
          modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

          3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
          that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
          when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
          following:

              a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
              Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
              an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
              site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
              your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

              b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

              c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
              with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
              a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
              documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

              d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

          4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
          executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

              a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
              together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
              to get the Standard Version.

              b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
              the Package with your modifications.

              c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
              document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
              with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

              d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

          5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
          Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
          Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
          you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
          commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
          distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
          product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
          an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
          form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
          interpreter is so embedded.

          6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
          output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
          under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
          them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
          Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
          Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
          binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
          neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
          fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
          not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
          Package.

          7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
          languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
          emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
          Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
          equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
          not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
          regression tests for the language.

          8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
          permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
          when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
          to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
          construed as a distribution of this Package.

          9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
          products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

          10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
