          This package is an SSL implementation written
          by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).

          The implementation was written so as to conform with Netscapes SSL.

          This library is free for commercial and non-commercial use as long as
          the following conditions are adhered to.  The following conditions
          apply to all code found in this distribution, be it the RC4, RSA,
          lhash, DES, etc., code; not just the SSL code.  The SSL documentation
          included with this distribution is covered by the same copyright terms
          except that the holder is Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com).

          Copyright remains Eric Young's, and as such any Copyright notices in
          the code are not to be removed.

          If this package is used in a product, Eric Young should be given attribution
          as the author of the parts of the library used.
          This can be in the form of a textual message at program startup or
          in documentation (online or textual) provided with the package.

          Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
          modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions

             The word 'cryptographic' can be left out if the routines from the library
             being used are not cryptographic related :-).

          4. If you include any Windows specific code (or a derivative thereof) from
             the apps directory (application code) you must include an acknowledgement:
