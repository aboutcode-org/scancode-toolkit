          is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
          and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
          with Digium, Inc. If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL
          applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,
          except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
          source tree in the file COPYING.

          This package also includes various components that are not part of
          Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
          and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
          GPL version 2 as well.

          Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright
          and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk
          package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
          for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or
          Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at
          runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our
          copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible
          licenses than GPL.

          If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
          there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
          GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we
          would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).

          Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
          and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.

          In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the
          Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface
          (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to
          manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed
          under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols
          do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,
          should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do
          fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to
          use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external
          applications licensed under any license you wish.

          The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,
          and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
          wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
          redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you
          should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
          steps you must take.

          File lacks copyright and licensing, but contains the comment
          "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it" which
          might be interpreted as a copyright holder not granting a license.
          More likely, however, the header file is considered non-copyrightable
          header with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:

           * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1 (according to git sources),
             together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment but
             also explicit copyright and licensing:
             <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.

           * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999 (according to git sources),
             at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it> released
             audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":

           Thank you for your trouble. I intended the software to be free. GPL is
