          License Terms:

          Use, Modification and Redistribution (including distribution of any
          modified or derived work) in source and binary forms is permitted only if
          each of the following conditions is met:

          1. Redistributions qualify as "freeware" or "Open Source Software" under

             (b) Redistributions are accompanied by a copy of the Source Code or by an
                 irrevocable offer to provide a copy of the Source Code for up to three
                 years at the cost of materials and delivery.  Such redistributions
                 must allow further use, modification, and redistribution of the Source

          3. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the Copyright Notice,
             these license terms, and the disclaimer/limitation of liability set
             forth as paragraph 6 below, in the documentation and/or other materials
             provided with the distribution.  For the purposes of binary distribution
             the "Copyright Notice" refers to the following language:
