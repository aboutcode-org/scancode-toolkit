      This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
      work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
      has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright
      notice for the Original Work:

          Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0

       1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
          royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
          duration of the copyright, to do the following:
          a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
             part of a collective work;
          b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
             Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative
             Works") based upon the Original Work;
          c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
             Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your
             choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions,
             including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this
             Academic Free License;
          d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
          e) to display the Original Work publicly.

       2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
          royalty-free, non- exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
          claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
          the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration
          of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and
          import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

       3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
          preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
          and all available documentation describing how to modify the
          Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
          of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
          the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
          right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
          copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
          calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
          as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

       4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
          the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of
          their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
          promote products derived from this Original Work without express
          prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated
          herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's
          trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
          intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
          sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any
          patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section
          2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
          such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this
          License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
          under terms different from this License any Original Work that
          Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

       5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
          distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
          Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works
          may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are
          distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as
          an application intended for use over a network. As an express
          condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
          External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative
          Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

       6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
          Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or
          trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as
          well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
          identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the
          Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
          prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
          recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

       7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
          warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
          patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor
          or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the
          permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent
          rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
          sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
          "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
          including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
          merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
          RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.  This
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
          License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
          License except under this disclaimer.

       8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
          theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
          otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
          indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
          character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
          Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
          goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
          and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
          liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
          such limitation.

       9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly
          assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and
          irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
          conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
          Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
          effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
          recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
          your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1,
          including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
          Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
          conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international
          treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright
          exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair
          dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no
          longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
          upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

      10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
          automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
          granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
          action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against¬†Licensor
          or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
          patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
          alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work
          with other software or hardware.

      11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
          to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
          jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
          conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
          jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
          application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
          International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
          Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
          termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
          copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This
          section shall survive the termination of this License.

      12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this
          License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
          shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
          without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred
          in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
          action. This section shall survive the termination of this
          License.

      13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
          unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
          necessary to make it enforceable.

      14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
          License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
          legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
          the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any
          entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
          with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the

          such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
          of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
          beneficial ownership of such entity.

      15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
          otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
          Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
          uses by You.
