               made by that particular Contributor.

               1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the
               combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
               including portions thereof.

               1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally
               accepted in the software development community for the electronic
               transfer of data.

               1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source
               Code.

               substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
               Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
               Modification is:
                    A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
                    containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

               1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
               making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus

               differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
               well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
               Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
               appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
               for no charge.

               1.12. "You" (or "Your")  means an individual or a legal entity
               exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this

               For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is
               controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of
               this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect,
               to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
               contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
               (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such
               entity.

          2. Source Code License.

               2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
               The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
               non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
               claims:
                    (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
                    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
                    Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
                    as part of a Larger Work; and

                    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
                    selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
                    sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
                    Original Code (or portions thereof).

                    (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
                    effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
                    Original Code under the terms of this License.

                    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
                    granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
                    separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
                    by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
                    combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

               2.2. Contributor Grant.
               Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
               hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

                    (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                    trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
                    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
                    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
                    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
                    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

                    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
                    selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
                    and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
                    of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
                    made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
                    Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
                    Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
                    Version (or portions of such combination).

                    (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
                    effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
                    the Covered Code.
                    (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                    granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
                    Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
                    3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
                    Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
                    by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
                    Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
                    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
                    that Contributor.

          3. Distribution Obligations.

               3.1. Application of License.
               The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
               governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
               Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
               distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
               of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
               copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
               distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
               version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
               License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
               an additional document offering the additional rights described in
               Section 3.5.

               3.2. Availability of Source Code.
               Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
               made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
               either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
               Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
               Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
               Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
               months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
               (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
               has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
               ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
               Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

               3.3. Description of Modifications.
               You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
               file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
               the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
               the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
               Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
               Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
               Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
               origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

               3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
                    (a) Third Party Claims.
                    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
                    intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
                    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                    Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
                    distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
                    party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
                    know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
                    the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
                    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                    (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                    reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
                    Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                    (b) Contributor APIs.
                    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
                    interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
                    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                    also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                         (c)    Representations.
                    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
                    Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
                    Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
                    Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
                    this License.

               3.5. Required Notices.
               You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
               Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
               Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
               location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
               to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
               You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
               Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
               for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
               rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
               charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
               obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
               may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
               Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
               offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
               Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
               Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

               3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
               You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
               requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
               and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
               the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
               including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
               obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
               in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
               collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
               Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
               Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
               contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
               compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
               Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
               rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
               license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
               from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
               Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
               the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
               terms You offer.

               3.7. Larger Works.
               You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
               not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
               Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
               requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

          4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

               If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
               License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
               statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
               the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
               describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
               must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
               be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
               extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
               sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
               understand it.

          5. Application of this License.

               This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
               attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

          6. Versions of the License.

               6.1. New Versions.
               Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
               and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
               will be given a distinguishing version number.

               6.2. Effect of New Versions.
               Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
               License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
               version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
               of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
               other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
               Covered Code created under this License.

               6.3. Derivative Works.
               If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
               only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
               governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
               the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
               "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
               license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
               and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
               contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
               Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
               Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
               Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
               this License.)

          7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
               COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
               WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
               DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
               THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
               IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
               YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
               COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
               OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
               ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

          8. TERMINATION.

               8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
               automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
               such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
               sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
               survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
               nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
               shall survive.

               8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
               claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
               or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
               You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

               (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
               infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
               Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
               shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
               unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
               agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
               royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
               Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
               the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
               of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
               mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
               is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
               Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
               the 60 day notice period specified above.

               (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
               Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
               any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
               and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
               sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
               Participant.

               8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
               alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
               indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
               by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
               infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
               granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
               into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
               license.

               8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
               all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
               which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
               prior to termination shall survive termination.

          9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

               UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
               (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
               DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
               OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
               ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
               CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
               WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
               COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
               INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
               LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
               RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
               PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
               EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
               THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

               The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
               48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
               software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
               terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
               C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
               all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
               rights set forth herein.

          11. MISCELLANEOUS.

               This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
               matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
               unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
               necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
               California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
               any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
               With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
               or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
               States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
               subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
               District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
               California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
               without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
               expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
               Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
               Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
               shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
               License.

          12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

               As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
               responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
               out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
               work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
               responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
               shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

          13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

               Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
               "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
               Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
               Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
               by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
