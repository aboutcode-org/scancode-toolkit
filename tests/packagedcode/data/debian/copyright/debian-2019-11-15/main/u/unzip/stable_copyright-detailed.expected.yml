          For the purposes of this copyright and license, "Info-ZIP" is defined as
          the following set of individuals:

             Mark Adler, John Bush, Karl Davis, Harald Denker, Jean-Michel Dubois,
             Jean-loup Gailly, Hunter Goatley, Ed Gordon, Ian Gorman, Chris Herborth,
             Dirk Haase, Greg Hartwig, Robert Heath, Jonathan Hudson, Paul Kienitz,
             David Kirschbaum, Johnny Lee, Onno van der Linden, Igor Mandrichenko,
             Steve P. Miller, Sergio Monesi, Keith Owens, George Petrov, Greg Roelofs,
             Kai Uwe Rommel, Steve Salisbury, Dave Smith, Steven M. Schweda,
             Christian Spieler, Cosmin Truta, Antoine Verheijen, Paul von Behren,
             Rich Wales, Mike White.

          This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express
          or implied.  In no event shall Info-ZIP or its contributors be held liable
          for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
          arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.

          Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
          including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
          freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

              1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
                 the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
                 of conditions.

              2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
                 must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
                 and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
                 provided with the distribution.  Additional documentation is not needed
                 for executables where a command line license option provides these and
                 a note regarding this option is in the executable's startup banner.  The
                 sole exception to this condition is redistribution of a standard
                 UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part of a self-extracting archive;
                 that is permitted without inclusion of this license, as long as the
                 normal SFX banner has not been removed from the binary or disabled.

              3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
                 systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
                 modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
                 versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
                 be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
                 compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
                 be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
                 limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
                 (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
                 capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
                 explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
                 prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
                 e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
                 will provide support for the altered versions.

              4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
                 "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
                 own source and binary releases.
