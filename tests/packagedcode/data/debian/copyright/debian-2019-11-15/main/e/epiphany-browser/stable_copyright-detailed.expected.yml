      THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
      CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
      PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
      OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
      PROHIBITED.

      BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
      AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
      LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
      RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
      AND CONDITIONS.

      1. Definitions

      "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
      work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or
      artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
      adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
      transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
      the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
      be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
      avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
      moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
      purpose of this License.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or
      artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than
      works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
      and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
      which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with
      one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
      independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
      collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
      License.
      "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
      https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
      Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
      including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
      have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of
      this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
      adaptations of works made available under that license under this
      License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License
      Elements as this License.  "Distribute" means to make available to the
      public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as
      appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
      "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
      selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
      Attribution, ShareAlike.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals,
      entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this
      License.
      "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
      the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or
      if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
      addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
      musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
      play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
      expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
      being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
      organization that transmits the broadcast.  "Work" means the literary
      and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including
      without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and
      artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression
      including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or
      dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb
      show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
      work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
      cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
      engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
      art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
      relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
      performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
      extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a
      variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered
      a literary or artistic work.
      "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
      respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
      Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
      violation.  "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of
      the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by
      any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
      digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
      way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
      at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
      public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
      the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
      to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
      sounds or images.
      "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
      without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
      fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
      protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
      medium.  2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
      reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
      arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
      connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
      applicable laws.

      3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
      exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

      to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections; to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
      steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
      were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
      marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
      modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
      to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
      in Collections; and, to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
      For the avoidance of doubt:

      Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
      which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
      right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License; Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
      those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
      statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
      waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
      You of the rights granted under this License; and, Voluntary License
      Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
      individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
      collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
      that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
      License.
      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
      known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
      such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
      in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
      expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

      4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
      made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
      this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
      recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
      under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
      must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
      Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
      may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
      restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
      rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
      Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
      this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
      remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
      requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
      You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
      credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.  You may Distribute or
      Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this
      License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
      Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
      (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License
      Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a
      Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
      one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of
      that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
      the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
      you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and
      the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI
      for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
      terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
      License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
      the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
      License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
      Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
      of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
      You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
      Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation
      from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
      Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
      the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
      the terms of the Applicable License.
      If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
      Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
      Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
      provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
      name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
      and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
      parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
      attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
      terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
      reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
      copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
      consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
      identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
      translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
      original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
      4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
      that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
      will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
      or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
      least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
      For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
      Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
      by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
      as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
      express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
      Attribution Parties.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
      Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
      Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
      as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
      which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
      Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
      exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
      to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
      modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
      Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
      applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
      under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
      otherwise.
      5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

      UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
      OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
      KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
      LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
      WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
      LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
      ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
      BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      7. Termination

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
      from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
      terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
      compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
      survive any termination of this License.  Subject to the above terms and
      conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
      the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
      Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
      terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
      that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
      other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
      terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
      effect unless terminated as stated above.

      8. Miscellaneous

      Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
      the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
      terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
      offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
      and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
      the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
      by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
      the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
      enforceable.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
      waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
      in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
      consent.
      This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
      appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
      without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.  The
      rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
      were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
      Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
      1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
      the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
      Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
      subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
      License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
      applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
      applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under
      this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
      License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
      rights under applicable law.

      Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
      does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
      Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
      other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
      information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

      Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

      Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
      conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
      original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
      and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
      following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
      exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

          Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
          intended for use by those authorized to give the public
          permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
          copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
          irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
          and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
          Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
          applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
          material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
          material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
          licensed material, or material used under an exception or
          limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
             wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

          Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
          licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
          licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
          the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
          example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
          copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
          licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
          other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
          the licensed material may still be restricted for other
          reasons, including because others have copyright or other
          rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
          such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
          Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
          respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
          for the public:

      Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
      License

      By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
      to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
      Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
      License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
      contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
      acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
      such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
      making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
      conditions.


      Section 1 -- Definitions.

        a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
           Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
           and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
           arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
           permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
           Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
           Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
           Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
           synched in timed relation with a moving image.

        b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
           and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
           accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

        c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
           creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative
           Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

        d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
           closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
           performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
           Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
           categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
           specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
           Rights.

        e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
           absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
           fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
           Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
           agreements.

        f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
           any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
           that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

        g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name
           of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this
           Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.

        h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
           or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
           License.

        i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
           terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
           all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
           Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

        j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
           under this Public License.

        k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
           process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
           as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
           dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
           available to the public including in ways that members of the
           public may access the material from a place and at a time
           individually chosen by them.

        l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
           resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
           the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
           as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
           equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

        m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
           under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


      Section 2 -- Scope.

        a. License grant.

             1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

                  a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                     in part; and

                  b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

             2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                its terms and conditions.

             3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                6(a).

             4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                (4) never produces Adapted Material.

             5. Downstream recipients.

                  a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                     recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                     receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                     Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                     Public License.

                  b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                     Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                     automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                     exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                     under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

                  c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                     any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                     apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                     Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                     Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                     Material.

             6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

        b. Other rights.

             1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                Rights, but not otherwise.

             2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                Public License.

             3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                reserves any right to collect such royalties.


      Section 3 -- License Conditions.

      Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
      following conditions.

        a. Attribution.

             1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                form), You must:

                  a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                     with the Licensed Material:

                       i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                          Material and any others designated to receive
                          attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                          the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                          designated);

                      ii. a copyright notice;

                     iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                      iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                          warranties;

                       v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                          extent reasonably practicable;

                  b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                     retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

                  c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                     Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                     hyperlink to, this Public License.

             2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                information.

             3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                reasonably practicable.

        b. ShareAlike.

           In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
           Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

             1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                license with the same License Elements, this version or
                later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

             2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                context in which You Share Adapted Material.

             3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


      Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

      Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
      apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

        a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
           to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
           portion of the contents of the database;

        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
           contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
           Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
           Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,

           including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
           all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
      replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
      Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


      Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

        a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
           EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
           AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
           ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
           IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
           WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
           PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
           ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
           KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
           ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

        b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
           TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
           NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
           INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
           COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
           USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
           ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
           DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
           IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
           above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
           possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
           waiver of all liability.


      Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
           Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
           this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
           terminate automatically.

        b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
           Section 6(a), it reinstates:

             1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                violation; or

             2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

           For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
           right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
           of this Public License.

        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
           Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
           distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
           will not terminate this Public License.

        d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
           License.


      Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
           terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
           Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
           independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


      Section 8 -- Interpretation.

        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
           shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
           conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
           be made without permission under this Public License.

        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
           deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
           minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
           cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
           without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
           conditions.

        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
           failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
           Licensor.

        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
           as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
           that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
           processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
