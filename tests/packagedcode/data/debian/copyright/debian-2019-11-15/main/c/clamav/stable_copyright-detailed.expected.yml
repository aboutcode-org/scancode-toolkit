          See COPYING.YARA. The GPL exception has been granted by upstream in
          https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11336:
           Steven Morgan 2015-07-21 23:02:01 CEST
           The Apache 2 license notification for YARA is in the file COPYING.YARA,
           similar to what we do for bzip2 and at least 9 other third party components
           included in ClamAV. We also maintain the Apache v2 license header within the
           YARA source code files as well as noting that the file is modified. We also
           intend to write a GPL exclusion, as is done for OpenSSL. We believe these to
           be sufficient indicators of which licenses apply to which source files.

          On Debian systems, the full text of the Apache License, Version 2.0 can be

          See COPYING.YARA. The GPL exception has been granted by upstream in
          https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11336:
           Steven Morgan 2015-07-21 23:02:01 CEST
           The Apache 2 license notification for YARA is in the file COPYING.YARA,
           similar to what we do for bzip2 and at least 9 other third party components
           included in ClamAV. We also maintain the Apache v2 license header within the
           YARA source code files as well as noting that the file is modified. We also
           intend to write a GPL exclusion, as is done for OpenSSL. We believe these to
           be sufficient indicators of which licenses apply to which source files.

          On Debian systems, the full text of the Apache License, Version 2.0 can be
          found in the file `/usr/share/common-licenses/Apache-2.0'.
