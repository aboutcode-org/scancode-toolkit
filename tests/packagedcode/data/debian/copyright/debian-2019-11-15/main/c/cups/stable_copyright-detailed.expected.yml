          it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

          The full text of the GPL is distributed as in
          /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 on Debian systems.

          In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
          the following special exception:

               1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

          a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
          for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
          Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
          third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
          for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
          CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
          or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
          considered to be a derivative work or collective work
          based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
          mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
          You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
          the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
          Software without releasing the source code of the
          Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
          filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
          Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
          source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

          b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
          software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,
          Inc., including but not limited to all existing
          releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,
          and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on
          releases and future versions thereof.

          c. This exception is only available for Apple
          OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
          that is distributed for use on other operating
          systems.

          d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
          exception have the following text at the top of each
          source file:

          This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
          Software exception.

               2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

          a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and
          distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL
          Toolkit.

          No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
          derived work.
