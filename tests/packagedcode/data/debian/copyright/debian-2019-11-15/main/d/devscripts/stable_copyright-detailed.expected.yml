          Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
          license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

          This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
          Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
          The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
          control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
          Package available as open source and free software.

          You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
          license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
          terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
          make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
          a different licensing arrangement.

          Definitions

          "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
          the copyright notice for the entire Package.

          "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
          material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
          procedures.

          "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
          or modify the Package.

          "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
          Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
          given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
          Modified Version.

          "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
          accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
          organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

          "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
          Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
          does not mean licensing fees.

          "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
          or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
          Copyright Holder.

          "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
          changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

          "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
          Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
          be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

          "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
          configuration files for the Package.

          "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
          any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
          of the Source form.

          Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

          (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
              Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided
              that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

          Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

          (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
              Standard Version of this Package in any medium without
              restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided
              that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
              associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies
              may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

          (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
              modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The
              resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version,
              and as such will be subject to the Original License.

          Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

          (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
              or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of
              the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it
              differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,
              documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules,
              and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

             (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
                 of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that
                 the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the
                 Standard Version.
             (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                 prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.
                 In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
                 different from the name of the Standard Version.
             (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
                 make the Source form of the Modified Version available to
                 others under
                 (i)  the Original License or
                 (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
                      modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the
                      same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the
                      licensee received, and requires that the Source form of
                      the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
                      be made freely available in that license fees are
                      prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.

          Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
          Versions without the Source

          (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
              the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on
              how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions
              must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these
              instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such
              distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions
              on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
              instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you
              become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not
              forfeit any of your rights under this license.

          (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
              the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect
              to the Source of the Modified Version.

          Aggregating or Linking the Package

          (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
              Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the
              resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing
              fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing
              fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The
              terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
              Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

          (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
              other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own,
              or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of
              applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result
              without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct
              interface to the Package.

          Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

          (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
              merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,
              cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such
              works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are
              not subject to the terms of this license.

          General Provisions

          (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
               Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By
               using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this
               license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you
               do not accept this license.

          (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
               Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless
               required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with
               the requirements of this license.

          (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
               service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

          (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
               free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
               sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to
               any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are
               necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent
               litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
               any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or
               contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to
               you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

          (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
               HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
               IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
               FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
               DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS
               REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE
               LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
               DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN
               IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
