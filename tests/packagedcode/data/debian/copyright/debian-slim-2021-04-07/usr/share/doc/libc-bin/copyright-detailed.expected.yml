              computer system, and to redistribute it freely, subject to the following
              restrictions:

              1. This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

              2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by
                 explicit claim or by omission. In practice, this means that if you use
                 PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
                 otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

                   Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
                   which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
                   by the University of Cambridge, England.

                 somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant
                 files or online help data or similar. A reference to the ftp site for
                 the source, that is, to

                   ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

                 should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
                 intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
                 it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
                 A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
                 independently).

              3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
                 misrepresented as being the original software.

              4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU
                General Purpose Licence (GPL), or Lesser General Purpose Licence (LGPL),
                then the terms of that licence shall supersede any condition above with
                which it is incompatible.
