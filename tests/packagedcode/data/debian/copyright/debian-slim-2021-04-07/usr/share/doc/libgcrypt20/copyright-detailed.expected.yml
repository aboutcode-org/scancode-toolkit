          The library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
              General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for the
              actual terms.  The helper programs (e.g. gcryptrnd and getrandom)
              as well as the documentation are distributed under the terms of
              the GNU General Public License (GPL); see the file COPYING for the
              actual terms.

              This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed
              with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free
              crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities
              similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of
              cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more
              sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities
              between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.

              Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be
              licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free
              software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does
              less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it
              covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for
              more explanation.

              Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
              distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
              license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
              open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
              a patent covering their implementation.

          License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
           January 9, 2013

           1 Definitions

           1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.

           1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United
           States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus
           for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,
           divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
           reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
           aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
           States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
           States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
           patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

           1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

           1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention
           claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
           a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
           computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
           not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
           field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

           1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
           and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
           source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
           and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
           (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
           public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
           Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
           licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
           2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
           requirements for the purposes of this license.

           1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
           Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
           Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
           any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
           Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
           not Open Source Software.

           2 License Grant

           2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
           including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
           grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
           non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
           any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
           Implementation.

           2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
           (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
           against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
           infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
           automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

           3 Disclaimer
           YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
           BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
           KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED
           PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUT ORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
           LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
           PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
           CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
           ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS, INCLUDING,
           WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
