          \ Copyright (C)  1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald\
          \ S. Karr\n Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n\n Everyone is\
          \ permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing\
          \ it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make the terms for other\
          \ programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\n\
          mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to\
          \ give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that\nyou get the rights we\
          \ want you to have, we need to make restrictions\nthat forbid anyone to deny you these\
          \ rights or to ask you to surrender\nthe rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n\
          \  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies\
          \ of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that\
          \ you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know\
          \ you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have\
          \ to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\n\
          copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You\
          \ must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must\
          \ tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain\
          \ that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified\
          \ by\nsomeone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\nthey have\
          \ is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not\
          \ reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr)\
          \ make the following \nterms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute\
          \ or change \nSMAIL.\n\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute\
          \ verbatim copies of SMAIL source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided\
          \ that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright\
          \ notice \"Copyright\n(C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\" (or with whatever\
          \ year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\n\
          License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients\
          \ of the SMAIL program a copy of this License\nAgreement along with the program. \
          \ You may charge a distribution fee\nfor the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\
          \n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,\nand copy\
          \ and distribute such modifications under the terms of\nParagraph 1 above, provided\
          \ that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent\
          \ notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\
          \n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in\
          \ whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or\n    any part thereof,\
          \ to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those\
          \ contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more\
          \ extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
          \n    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring\
          \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for\
          \ a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\n\
          derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other\
          \ program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL\
          \ (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Paragraph 2) in object code or executable\
          \ form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one\
          \ of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n\
          \    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and\
          \ 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n\
          \    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge)\
          \ a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed\
          \ under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with\
          \ the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may\
          \ be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for non-commercial distribution\
          \ and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\
          \nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\nall\
          \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code\
          \ for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on\
          \ which the executable file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute\
          \ or transfer SMAIL\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any\
          \ attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and\n\
          your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be\nautomatically\
          \ terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\nsoftware programs from\
          \ you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long\
          \ as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts\
          \ of SMAIL into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different,\
          \ write to Landon\nCurt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at\
          \ 51\nFranklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet\nworked\
          \ out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often\npermit this.  We will\
          \ be guided by the two goals of preserving the\nfree status of all derivatives of\
          \ our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software.\n\nYour comments\
          \ and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!  This\
          \ contract was based on the contract made by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  Please\

          \ MA 02110-1301,\nUSA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in\n\
          general.\n\n\t\t       NO WARRANTY\n\n  BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,\
          \ WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO\nWARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE\
          \ LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR\

          \ MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\
          \ QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH\nYOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\
          \ ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  IN NO EVENT\
          \ UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &\nRONALD S. KARR AND/OR\
          \ ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE\nSMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\
          \ TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nLOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL,\
          \ INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n\
          (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES\
