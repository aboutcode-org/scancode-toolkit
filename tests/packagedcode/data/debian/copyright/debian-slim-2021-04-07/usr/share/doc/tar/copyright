This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU tar.  GNU
tar, heavily based on John Gilmore's public domain version of tar,
was originally written by Graham Todd.  It is now maintained by
Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>.

This package is maintained for Debian by Janos Lenart <ocsi@debian.org>, and
was built from the sources found at:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tar/

More recently, I'm directly using the upstream source repository at 

	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git
