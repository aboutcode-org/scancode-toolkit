          GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

          Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

          Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
          license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
          permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
          3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
          bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
          the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

          When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
          certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
          program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
          non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
          header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

          0. Definitions.

          A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
          Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
          interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
          on the Runtime Library.

          "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
          modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
          the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
          subsequent versions published by the FSF.

          "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
          modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
          the license of GCC.

          "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
          target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
          input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
          phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
          format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
          for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

          The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
          non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
          Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
          use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
          part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
          understood as starting with the output of the generators or
          preprocessors.

          A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
          with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
          work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
          optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
          Eligible Compilation Process.

          1. Grant of Additional Permission.

          You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
          combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
          propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
          all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
          may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
          consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

          2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

          The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
          presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
          requirements of the license of GCC.
