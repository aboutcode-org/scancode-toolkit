          The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
            the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
            See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
            Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
            please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
