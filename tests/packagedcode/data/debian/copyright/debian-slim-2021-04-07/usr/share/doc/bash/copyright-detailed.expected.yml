          The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
          Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
          no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
          interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
          and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
          exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
          based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.
