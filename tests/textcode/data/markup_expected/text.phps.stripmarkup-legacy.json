  "* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange",
  "* format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines",
  "* to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript",
  "* Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.",
  "* This feature can also be found in  Python. JSON is a text format that is",
  "* completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar",
  "* to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,",
  "* JavaScript, Perl, TCL, and many others. These properties make JSON an",
  "* ideal data-interchange language.",
  "*",
  "* This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It",
  "* is intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make",
  "* use of HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can",
  "* be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or",
  "* decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to",
  "* Javascript, and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing",
  "* overhead",
  "*",
  "* All strings should be in ASCII or UTF-8 format!",
