/**
 * Converts to and from JSON format.
 *
 * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
 * format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines
 * to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
 * Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
 * This feature can also be found in  Python. JSON is a text format that is
 * completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar
 * to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
 * JavaScript, Perl, TCL, and many others. These properties make JSON an
 * ideal data-interchange language.
 *
 * This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It
 * is intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make
 * use of HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can
 * be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or
 * decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to
 * Javascript, and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing
 * overhead
 *
 * All strings should be in ASCII or UTF-8 format!
