notes: this is a snapshot of Fossology copyright test suite data (which is not 
 actually running with assertions in Fossology). It has been modified to adapt 
 assertions to the scancode results.
 The original test files are composed of a pair of files with the same unique
 name prefix. The file with a _raw suffix contains the original text annotated
 with <s> </s> debian-like tags to delimite the copyright that should be
 detected.
