    CHANGE LOG:


       Version 1.5.1:

           Removed a bug from the implementation of the right
           circular shift operator.

       Version 1.5:

           This version should prove to be much more efficient
           for long bit vectors.  Efficiency in BitVector 
           construction when only its size is specified was 
           achieved by eliminating calls to _setbit().  
           The application of logical operators to two
           BitVectors of equal length was also made efficient 
           by eliminating calls to the padding function.
           Another feature of this version is the count_bits()
           method that returns the total number of bits set
           in a BitVector instance.  Yet another feature of
           this version is the setValue() method that alters
           the bit pattern associated with a previously 
           constructed BitVector.
       
       Version 1.4.1:

           The reset() method now returns 'self' to allow for
           cascaded inovocation with the slicing operator.
           Also removed the discrepancy between the value of the
           __copyright__ variable in the module and the value of
          license variable in setup.py.

       Version 1.4:

           This version includes the following two upgrades: 
           1) code for slice assignment; and 2) A reset function 
           to reinitialize a previously constructed BitVector.  
           Additionally, the code was cleaned up with the help of 
           pychecker.

       Version 1.3.2:

           Fixed a potentially misleading documentation issue for
           the Windows users of the BitVector class.  If you are 
           writing an internally generated BitVector to a disk file, 
           you must open the file in the binary mode.  If you don't,
           the bit patterns that correspond to line breaks will be
           misinterpreted.  On a Windows machine in the text mode,
           the bit pattern 000001010 ('\\n') will be written out
           to the disk as 0000110100001010 ('\\r\\n').

       Version 1.3.1:

           Removed the inconsistency in the internal representation
           of bit vectors produced by logical bitwise operations
           vis-a-vis the bit vectors created by the constructor.
           Previously, the logical bitwise operations resulted in bit 
           vectors that had their bits packed into lists of ints, 
           as opposed to arrays of unsigned shorts. 

       Version 1.3:

           (a) One more constructor mode included: When initializing
           a new bit vector with an integer value, you can now also
           specify a size for the bit vector.  The constructor 
           zero-pads the bit vector from the left with zeros. (b) The 
           BitVector class now supports 'if x in y' syntax to test if 
           the bit pattern 'x' is contained in the bit pattern 'y'. 
           (c) Improved syntax to conform to well-established Python 
           idioms. (d) What used to be a comment before the beginning 
           of each method definition is now a docstring.

       Version 1.2:

           (a) One more constructor mode included: You can now construct
           a bit vector directly from a string of 1's and 0's.  (b) The
           class now constructs a shortest possible bit vector from an
           integer value.  So the bit vector for the integer value 0 is
           just one bit of value 0, and so on. (c) All the rich
           comparison operators are now overloaded. (d) The class now
           includes a new method 'intValue()' that returns the unsigned
           integer value of a bit vector.  This can also be done through
           '__int__'. (e) The package now includes a unittest based
           framework for testing out an installation.  This is in a
           separate directory called "TestBitVector".
       
       Version 1.1.1:

           The function that does block reads from a disk file now peeks
           ahead at the end of each block to see if there is anything
           remaining to be read in the file.  If nothing remains, the
           more_to_read attribute of the BitVector object is set to
           False.  This simplifies reading loops. This version also
           allows BitVectors of size 0 to be constructed


       Version 1.1:

           I have changed the API significantly to provide more ways for
           constructing a bit vector.  As a result, it is now necessary
           to supply a keyword argument to the constructor.
       


    INSTALLATION:

       The BitVector class has been packaged using Distutils.  
       For installation, execute the following command-line in the 
       source directory (this is the directory that contains the 
       setup.py file after you have downloaded and uncompressed the 
       package):
 
           python setup.py install

       You have to have root privileges for this to work.  On Linux 
       distributions, this will install the module file at a location 
       that looks like

            /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

       If you do not have root access, you have the option of 
       working directly off the directory in which you downloaded 
       the software by simply placing the following statements at 
       the top of your scripts that use the BitVector class

           import sys
           sys.path.append( "pathname_to_BitVector_directory" )

       To uninstall the module, simply delete the source directory,
       locate where BitVector was installed with "locate BitVector"
       and delete those files.  As mentioned above, the full 
       pathname to the installed version is likely to look like
       /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/BitVector*

       If you want to carry out a non-standard install of BitVector,
       look up the on-line information on Disutils by pointing your
       browser to 

              http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html




    INTRODUCTION:
   
       The BitVector class for a memory-efficient packed representation
       of bit arrays and for logical operations on such arrays.  The
       core idea used in this Python script for bin packing is based on
       an internet posting by Josiah Carlson to the Pyrex mailing list.

       Operations supported on bit vectors:

              __getitem__
              __setitem__
              __len__
              __iter__
              __contains__
              __getslice__
              __str__
              __int__
              __add__
              __eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__
              |            for bitwise or
              &            for bitwise and              
              ^            for bitwise xor
              ~            for bitwise inversion
              <<           for circular rotation to the left
              >>           for circular rotation to the right
              +            for concatenation
              intValue()   for returning the integer value 
              divide_into_two
              permute
              unpermute
              pad_from_left
              pad_from_right
              read_bits_from_file
              write_to_file
              read_bits_from_fileobject
              write_bits_to_fileobject
              reset
              slice assignment
              count_bits
              setValue



    CONSTRUCTING BIT VECTORS:


        You can construct a bit vector in six different ways.
   
        (1) You can construct a bit vector directly from either a tuple
            or a list of bits, as in

               bv =  BitVector( bitlist = [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1] ) 
 
        (2) You can construct a bit vector from an integer by

               bv =  BitVector( intVal = 56789 )

            The bits stored now will correspond to the binary
            representation of the integer.  The resulting bit vector is
            the shortest possible bit vector for the integer value
            supplied.  For example, when intVal is 0, the bit vector
            constructed will consist of just the bit 0.


        (3) When initializing a bit vector with an intVal as shown
            above, you can also specify a size for the bit vector:

               bv = BitVector( intVal = 0, size = 8 )

            will return the bit vector consisting of the bit pattern
            00000000.  The zero padding needed for meeting the size
            requirement is always on the left.  If the size supplied is
            smaller than what it takes to create the shortest possible
            bit vector for intVal, an exception is thrown.

                
        (4) You can create a zero-initialized bit vector of a given size
            by

               bv  = BitVector( size = 62 )

            This bit vector will hold exactly 62 bits, all initialized to
            the 0 bit value.

        (5) You can construct a bit vector from a disk file by a two-step
            procedure. First you construct an instance of bit vector by
   
               bv  =  BitVector( filename = 'somefile' )   

            This bit vector itself is incapable of holding the bits.  To
            now create bit vectors that actually hold the bits, you need
            to make the following sort of a call on the above variable
            bv:
 
               bv1 =  bv.read_bits_from_file( 64 )    

            bv1 will be a regular bit vector containing 64 bits from the
            disk file. If you want to re-read a file from the beginning
            for some reason, you must obviously first close the file
            object that was acquired with a call to the BitVector
            constructor with a filename argument.  This can be
            accomplished by

              bv.close_file_object()

        (6) You can construct a bit vector from a string of 1's and 0's
            by
 
               bv  =  BitVector( bitstring = '110011110000' )      
   
        (7) Yet another way to construct a bit vector is to read the bits
            directly from a file-like object, as in
  
               x = "111100001111"
               fileobj = StringIO.StringIO( x )
               bv = BitVector( fp = fileobj )


   
    OPERATIONS SUPPORTED BY THE BITVECTOR CLASS:
    
    DISPLAYING BIT VECTORS:


        1)  Since the BitVector class implements the __str__ method, a
            bit vector can be displayed on a terminal by

                  print bitvec

            Basically, you can always obtain the string representation
            of a bit vector by

                  str( bitvec )

            and integer value by

                  int( bitvec )



    ACCESSING AND SETTING INDIVIDUAL BITS AND SLICES:

   
        2)  Any single bit of a bit vector bv can be set to 1 or 0 by
 
                  bv[M] = 1_or_0
                  print bv[M]

            for accessing (and setting) the bit at the position that is
            indexed M.  You can retrieve the bit at position M by bv[M].

        3)  A slice of a bit vector obtained by

                  bv[i:j]

            is a bit vector constructed from the bits at index positions
            from i through j-1.

        4)  You can also carry out slice assignment:

                  bv1 = BitVector( size = 25 )
                  bv2 = BitVector( bitstring = '1010001' )
                  bv1[6:9]  = bv2[0:3]
                  bv3 = BitVector( bitstring = '101' )                 
                  bv1[0:3]  = bv3

            The first slice assignment will set the 6th, 7th, and 
            the 8th bits of the bit vector bv1 according to the first
            three bits of bv2.  The second slice assignment will set
            the first three bits of bv1 according to the three bits
            in bv3.

        5)  You can iterate over a bit vector, as illustrated by

                  for bit in bitvec:
                      print bit,   

            This is made possible by the override definition for the
            special __iter__() method.

        6)  Negative subscripts for array-like indexing are supported.
            Therefore,

                  bitvec[ -i ]

            is legal assuming that the index range is not violated.

        7)  You can reset a previously constructed bit vector to
            either the all zeros state or the all ones state by

                  bv1 = BitVector( size = 25 )
                  ...
                  ...
                  bv1.reset( 1 )
                  ...
                  ...
                  bv1.reset( 0 )

            The first call to reset() will set all the bits of
            bv1 to 1's and the second call all bit to 0's.



    LOGICAL OPERATIONS ON BIT VECTORS:

   
        8) Given two bit vectors bv1 and bv2, you can perform bitwise
           logical operations on them by

                  result_bv  =  bv1 ^ bv2
                  result_bv  =  bv1 & bv2
                  result_bv  =  bv1 | bv2
                  result_bv  =  ~bv1



    COMPARING BIT VECTORS:

        9) Given two bit vectors bv1 and bv2, you can carry out the
           following comparisons that return Boolean values:

                  bv1 ==  bv2
                  bv1 !=  bv2
                  bv1 <   bv2
                  bv1 <=  bv2
                  bv1 >   bv2
                  bv1 >=  bv2

           The equalities and inequalities are determined by the integer
           values associated with the bit vectors.


   

    OTHER SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:

   
       10)  You can permute and un-permute bit vectors:

                  bv_permuted   =  bv.permute( permutation_list )

                  bv_unpermuted =  bv.unpermute( permutation_list )


       11)  Left and right circular rotations can be carried out by
 
                  bitvec  << N 

                  bitvec  >> N

            for circular rotations to the left and right by N bit
            positions.


       12)  A bit vector containing an even number of bits can be
            divided into two equal parts by

                  [left_half, right_half] = bitvec.divide_into_two()

             where left_half and right_half hold references to the two
             returned bit vectors.


       13)  You can find the integer value of a bit array by

                  bitvec.invValue()

            or by

                  int( bitvec )


       14)  You can convert a bit vector into its string representation
            by

                  str( bitvec )


       15)  Because __add__ is supplied, you can always join two
            bit vectors by

                  bitvec3  =  bitvec1  +  bitvec2

            bitvec3 is a new bit vector that contains all the
            bits of bitvec1 followed by all the bits of bitvec2.

             
       16)  You can write a bit vector directly to a file, as
            illustrated by the following example that reads one bit
            vector from a file and then writes it to another
            file

                  bv = BitVector( filename = 'input.txt' )
                  bv1 = bv.read_bits_from_file(64)        
                  print bv1           
                  FILEOUT = open( 'output.bits', 'wb' )
                  bv1.write_to_file( FILEOUT )
                  FILEOUT.close()
                  bv = BitVector( filename = 'output.bits' )
                  bv2 = bv.read_bits_from_file( 64 )
                  print bv2

             IMPORTANT:  The size of bit vector must be a multiple of
                         of 8 for this write function to work.  If this
                         condition is not met, the function throws an
                         exception.

             IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:  When writing an internally
                         generated bit vector out to a disk file, it
                         is important to open the file in the binary
                         mode as shown.  Otherwise, the bit pattern
                         00001010 ('\\n') in your bitstring will be written 
                         out as 0000110100001010 ('\\r\\n'), which is the
                         linebreak on Windows machine.

       17)  You can also write a bit vector directly to a stream
            object, as illustrated by

                  fp_write = StringIO.StringIO()
                  bitvec.write_bits_to_fileobject( fp_write )
                  print fp_write.getvalue()         # 111100001111 
             

       18)  You can pad a bit vector from the left or from the
            right with a designated number of zeros

                  bitvec.pad_from_left( n )

                  bitvec.pad_from_right( n )

            In the first case, the new bit vector will be the same
            as the old bit vector except for the additional n zeros
            on the left.  The same thing happens in the second
            case except that now the additional n zeros will be on
            the right.

       19)  You can test if a bit vector x is contained in another bit
            vector y by using the syntax 'if x in y'.  This is made
            possible by the override definition for the special
            __contains__() method.

       20)  You can count the number of bits set in a BitVector 
            instance by

              bv = BitVector( bitstring = '100111' )
              print bv.count_bits()                     # 4

       21)  You can change the bit pattern associated with a
            previously constructed BitVector instance:

              bv = BitVector( intVal = 7, size =16 )
              print bv                              # 0000000000000111
              bv.setValue( intVal = 45 )
              print bv                              # 101101
              


    HOW THE BIT VECTORS ARE STORED:
   
        The bits of a bit array are stored in 16-bit unsigned ints.
        After resolving the argument with which the constructor is
        called (which happens in lines (A2) through (A70) of the file
        BitVector.py), the very first thing that the constructor does is
        to figure out in line (A78) as to how many of those 2-byte ints
        it needs for the bits.  For example, if you wanted to store a
        64-bit array, the variable 'two_byte_ints_needed' in line (A78)
        would be set to 4. (This does not mean that the size of a bit
        vector must be a multiple of 16.  Any sized bit vectors can
        constructed using the required number of two-byte ints.) Line
        (A79) then creates an array of 2-byte ints and initializes it
        with the required number of zeros.  Lines (A80) then shifts the
        bits into the array of two-byte ints.

        As mentioned above, note that it is not necessary for the size
        of the vector to be a multiple of 16 even though we are using
        C's unsigned short as as a basic unit for storing the bit
        arrays.  The class BitVector keeps track of the actual number of
        bits in the bit vector through the "size" instance attribute.

        With regard to the code in lines (A2) through (A77) of the file
        BitVector.py, note that, except for one case, the constructor
        must be called with a single keyword argument, which determines
        how the bit vector will be constructed.  The single exception to
        this rule is for the keyword argument 'intVal' which can be used
        along with the 'size' keyword argument.  When 'intVal' is used
        with the 'size' option, the bit vector constructed for the
        integer is the shortest possible bit vector.  On the other hand,
        when 'size' is also specified, the bit vector is padded with
        zeroes from the left so that it has the specified size.

        Lines (A16) through (A22) are for the following sort of a call

               bv = BitVector( filename = 'myfilename' )

        This call returns a bit vector on which you must subsequently
        invoke the 'read_bits_from_file()' method to actually obtain a
        bit vector consisting of the bits that constitute the
        information stored in the file.

        Lines (A23) through (A28) are for the case when you want to
        construct a bit vector by reading the bits off a file-like
        object, as in

              x = "111100001111"
              fileobj = StringIO.StringIO( x )
              bv = BitVector( fp = fileobj )

        Lines (A29) through (A61) are for the case when you want to
        construct a bit vector from an integer, as in

              bv = BitVector( intVal = 123456 )

        The bits stored in the bit vector will correspond to the binary
        representation of the integer argument provided.  The bit vector
        constructed with the above call will be the shortest possible
        bit vector for the integer supplied.  As a case in point, when
        the intVal is 0, the bit vector will consist of a single bit
        which will be 0 also.  The code in lines (A27) through (A59) can
        also handle the following sort of a call

              bv = BitVector( intVal = 46, size = 16 )        

        which returns a bit vector of a specfic size by padding the
        shortest possible bit vector the the intVal with zeros from the
        left.
        
        Lines (A62) through (A68) are for constructing a bit vector with
        just the size information, as in

              bv = BitVector( size = 61 )

        This returns a bit vector that will hold exactly 61 bits, all
        initialized to the zero value.

        Lines (A69) through (A73) are for constructing a bit vector from
        a bitstring, as in

              bv = BitVector( bitstring = '00110011111' )

        Finally, lines (A74) through (A77) are for constructing a bit
        vector from a list or a tuple of the individual bits:
          
              bv = BitVector( bitlist = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1) )

        The bit vector constructed is initialized with the supplied
        bits.

   

    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

        The author is grateful to Oleg Broytmann for suggesting many
        improvements that were incorporated in Version 1.1 of this
        package.  The author would like to thank Kurt Schwehr whose
        email resulted in the creation of Version 1.2.  Kurt also caught
        an error in my earlier version of 'setup.py' and suggested a
        unittest based approach to the testing of the package.  Kurt
        also supplied the Makefile that is included in this
        distribution.  The author would also like to thank all (Scott
        Daniels, Blair Houghton, and Steven D'Aprano) for their
        responses to my comp.lang.python query concerning how to make a
        Python input stream peekable.  This feature was included in
        Version 1.1.1.

        With regard to the changes incorporated in Version 1.3, thanks
        are owed to Kurt Schwehr and Gabriel Ricardo for bringing to my
        attention the bug related to the intVal method of initializing a
        bit vector when the value of intVal exceeded sys.maxint. This
        problem is fixed in Version 1.3.  Version 1.3 also includes many
        other improvements that make the syntax better conform to the
        standard idioms of Python.  These changes and the addition of
        the new constructor mode (that allows a bit vector of a given
        size to be constructed from an integer value) are also owing to
        Kurt's suggestions.

        With regard to the changes incorporated in Version 1.3.1, I
        would like to thank Michael Haggerty for noticing that the
        bitwise logical operators resulted in bit vectors that had their
        bits packed into lists of ints, as opposed to arrays of 
        unsigned shorts.  This inconsistency in representation has been 
        removed in version 1.3.1.  Michael has also suggested that 
        since BitVector is mutable, I should be overloading __iand__(), 
        __ior__(), etc., for in-place modifications of bit vectors.  
        Michael certainly makes a good point. But I am afraid that this 
        change will break the code for the existing users of the 
        BitVector class. 

        I thank Mathieu Roy for bringing to my attention the problem
        with writing bitstrings out to a disk files on Windows 
        machines.  This turned out to be a problem more with the
        documentation than with the BitVector class itself.  On a 
        Windows machine, it is particularly important that a file
        you are writing a bitstring into be opened in binary mode
        since otherwise the bit pattern 00001010 ('\\n') will be written 
        out as 0000110100001010 ('\\r\\n').  This documentation fix 
        resulted in Version 1.3.2.

        With regard to Version 1.4, the suggestions/bug reports
        made by John Kominek, Bob Morse, and Steve Ward contributed
        to this version.  I wish to thank all three. John wanted me 
        to equip the class with a reset() method so that a previously
        constructed class could be reset to either all 0's or all
        1's. Bob spotted loose local variables in the implementation
        --- presumably left over from a debugging phase of the code.
        Bob recommended that I clean up the code with pychecker. That
        has been done.  Steve noticed that slice assignment was not
        working.  It should work now.

        Version 1.4.1 was prompted by John Kominek suggesting that
        if reset() returned self, then the slice operation could
        be combined with the reset operation.  Thanks John!  Another
        reason for 1.4.1 was to remove the discrepancy between the 
        value of the __copyright__ variable in the module and the 
        value of license variable in setup.py.  This discrepancy 
        was brought to my attention by David Eyk.  Thanks David!

        Version 1.5 has benefited greatly by the suggestions made
        by Ryan Cox.  By examining the BitVector execution with
        cProfile, Ryan observed that my implementation was making
        unnecessary method calls to _setbit() when just the size
        option is used for constructing a BitVector instance.
        Since Python allocates cleaned up memory, it is unnecessary 
        to set the individual bits of a vector if it is known in 
        advance that they are all zero. Ryan made a similar observation 
        for the logical operations applied to two BitVector instances 
        of equal length.  He noticed that I was making unnecessary 
        calls to _resize_pad_from_left() for the case of equal 
        arguments to logical operations.  Ryan also recommended that 
        I include a method that returns the total number of bits 
        set in a BitVector instance.  The new method count_bits() does 
        exactly that. Thanks Ryan for all your suggestions.
        Version 1.5 also includes the method setValue() that allows 
        the internally stored bit pattern associated with a previously
        constructed BitVector to be changed.  A need for this method
        was expressed by Aleix Conchillo.  Thanks Aleix.
        
        Version 1.5.1 is a quick release to fix a bug in the 
        right circular shift operator.  This bug was discovered
        by Jasper Spaans.  Thanks very much Jasper.
