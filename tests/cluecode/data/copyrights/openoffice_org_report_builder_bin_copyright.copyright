 	claims: 
 
 	(a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or 
 	trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify,

 	(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective 
 	on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under 
 	the terms of this License. 
 
 	(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is 
 	granted: 1) 	for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) 
 	separate from the 	Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: 
 	i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the 
 	Original Code with other software or devices.

 	Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor 
 	Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by 
 	Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
 
 3. Distribution Obligations. 
 
 3.1. Application of License.
 
 	The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are 
 	governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation 
 	Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be 
 	distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version 
 	of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a 
 	copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You 
 	distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code 
 	version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
 	License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include 
 	an additional document offering the additional rights described in 
 	Section 3.5. 
 
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 
 	Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be 
 	made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License 
 	either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted 
 	Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an 
 	Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic 
 	Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) 
 	months after the date it initially became available, or at least six 
 	(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification 
 	has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for 
 	ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the 
 	Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
 
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 
 	You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a 
 	file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and 
 	the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that 
 	the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original 
 	Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the 
 	Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an 
 	Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the 
 	origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
 
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
 
 	(a) Third Party Claims.
 
 	If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's 
 	intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights 
 	granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor 
 	must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled 
 	"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in 
 	sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
 	Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made 
 	available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly 
 	modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available 
 	thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate 
 	mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who 
 	received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
 
 	(b) Contributor APIs.
 
 	If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming 
 	interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses 
 	which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must 
 	also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
 
 	(c) Representations.
 
 	Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 
 	3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications 
 	are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has 
 	sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 
 3.5. Required Notices.
 
 	You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source 
 	Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source 
 	Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a 
 	location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely 
 	to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) 
 	You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in 
 	Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation 
 	for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership 
 	rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to 
 	charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
 	obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
 	may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
 	Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than 
 	any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is 
 	offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
 	Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
 	Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, 
 	support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
 
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 
 	You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the 
 	requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, 
 	and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of 
 	the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 
 	including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the 
 	obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included 
 	in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or 
 	collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the 
 	Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered 
 	Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may 
 	contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in 
 	compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the 
 	Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's 
 	rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this 
 	License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different 
 	license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ 
 	from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
 	Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
 	Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
 	the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
 	terms You offer. 
 
 3.7. Larger Works.
 
 	You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code 
 	not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger 
 	Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
 	requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
 
 	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
 	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to 
 	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
 	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
 	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description 
 	must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must 
 	be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the 
 	extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 
 	sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to 
 	understand it.
 
 5. Application of this License. 
 
 	This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has 
 	attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 
 6. Versions of the License. 
 
 6.1. New Versions.
 
 	Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions 
 	of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
 	distinguishing version number. 
 
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 
 	Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
 	License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that 
 	version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms 
 	of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one 
 	other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered 
 	Code created under this License. 
 
 6.3. Derivative Works.
 
 	If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may 
 	only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code 
 	governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that 
 	the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL" or any confusingly 
 	similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your 
 	license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear 
 	that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the 
 	Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, 
 	Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A 
 	shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
 	License.)
 
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
 
 	COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, 
 	WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
 	WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF 
 	DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
 	THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE 
 	IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, 
 	YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE 
 	COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
 	OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF 
 	ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 
 8. TERMINATION. 
 
 	8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
 	automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure 
 	such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All 
 	sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall 
 	survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their 
 	nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
 	shall survive. 
 
 	8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement 
 	claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
 	or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom 
 	You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that: 
 
 	(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly 
 	infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such 
 	Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
 	shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, 
 	unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  
 	agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable 
 	royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such 
 	Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to 
 	the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days 
 	of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not 
 	mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim 
 	is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under 
 	Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of 
 	the 60 day notice period specified above. 
 
 	(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
 	Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
 	any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) 
 	and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, 
 	sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that 
 	Participant. 
 
 	8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant 
 	alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
 	indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as 
 	by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
 	infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
 	granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
 	into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
 	license. 
 
 	8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all 
 	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) 
 	which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
 	prior to termination shall survive termination.
 
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
 
 	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
 	(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL 
 	DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, 
 	OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR 
 	ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
 	CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, 
 	WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
 	COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN 
 	INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF 
 	LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
 	RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
 	PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
 	EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
 	THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
 
 	The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 
 	C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" 
 	and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are 
 	used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 
 	12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
 	U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights 
 	set forth herein.
 
 11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
 
 	This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject 
 	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
 	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
 	necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by 
 	California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if 
 	any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. 
 	With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, 
 	or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United 
 	States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be 
 	subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern 
 	District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, 
 	California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including 
 	without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and 
 	expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on 
 	Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
 	Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
 	shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this 
 	License.
 
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
 
 	As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is 
 	responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, 
 	out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
 	work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 
 	responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
 	shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 
 
 	Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 
 	?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial 
 	Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under 
 	Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the 
 	Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
 
 Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice. 
 
 	The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License 
 	Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in 
 	compliance with the License. A copy of the License is available at

 	The Original Code is _________________. The Initial Developer of the 
 	Original Code is ___________. Portions created by ______ are Copyright 
 	(C)_________. All Rights Reserved.
 
 	Contributor(s): ______________________________________. 
 
 	Alternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the terms

      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
      claims:
           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
           trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
           modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
           Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
           as part of a Larger Work; and
 
           (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
           selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
           sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
           Original Code (or portions thereof).
 
           (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
           effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
           Original Code under the terms of this License.
 
           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
           granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
           separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
           by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
           combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
 
      2.2. Contributor Grant.
      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
 
           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
           display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
           created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
           unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
           and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
 
           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
           selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
           and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
           of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
           made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
           Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
           Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
           Version (or portions of such combination).
 
           (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
           effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
           the Covered Code.
           (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
           granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
           Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made

           Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
           that Contributor.
 
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 
      3.1. Application of License.
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.
 
      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 
      3.3. Description of Modifications.
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
           (a) Third Party Claims.
           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 
           (b) Contributor APIs.
           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 
                (c)    Representations.
           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
           this License.
 
      3.5. Required Notices.
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
      terms You offer.
 
      3.7. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
      understand it.
 
 5. Application of this License.
 
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 
 6. Versions of the License.
 
      6.1. New Versions.
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
      will be given a distinguishing version number.
 
      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.
 
      6.3. Derivative Works.
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
      this License.)
 
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 
 8. TERMINATION.
 
      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
      shall survive.
 
      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 
      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
      the 60 day notice period specified above.
 
      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
      Participant.
 
      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
      license.
 
      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
      prior to termination shall survive termination.
 
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 
      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
      rights set forth herein.
 
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
      License.
 
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 
      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
