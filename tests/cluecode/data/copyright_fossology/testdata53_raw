This is a collection of programs from 4.4BSD-Lite that have not (yet)
need re-written by FSF as GNU.  It was constructed for inclusion in
Debian Linux.  As programs found here become available from GNU sources,
they will be replaced.

This package was originally put together by Austin Donnelly
<and1000@debian.org>, but is heavily based on bsdutils, originally put
together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  Please report any
problems or suggested additions or changes to Austin Donnelly.

Then the package has been maintained by Charles Briscoe-Smith
<cpbs@debian.org>.  I gathered data for the 1999-2001 calendar files
from various sources on the Internet, and I'd also like to thank Oliver
Elphick, Julian Gilbey, Daniel Martin and Jaldhar H. Vyas for providing
much useful data on the various religous calendars.  I have edited the
files they provided to fit calendar's requirements, so any errors should
be attributed to me.

After cpbs@debian.org, Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> maintained it for
almost two years, before Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org> took over.
The package is now maintained by Graham Wilson <bob@decoy.wox.org>.
