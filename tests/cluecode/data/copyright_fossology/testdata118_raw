  LEGAL ISSUES
  ============

  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
  implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
  merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software
  is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to
  its quality and accuracy.

  This software is <s>copyright (c) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane</s>.  All
  Rights Reserved except as specified below.

  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute
  this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
  subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for
  this software is distributed, then this README file must be
  included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and
  any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be
  clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.  (2) If only
  executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
  must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the
  Independent JPEG Group".  (3) Permission for use of this software is
  granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any
  undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for
  damages of any kind.

  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
  IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work,
  you ought to acknowledge us.

  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
  company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software
  or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only
  as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
  basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or
  liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

  ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of
  L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its <s>copyright holder, Aladdin
  Enterprises of Menlo Park</s>, CA.  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the
  above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual
  distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
  that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the
  file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not
  needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does
  not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

  The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
  Autoconf.  It is <s>copyright by the Free Software Foundation</s> but is
  freely distributable.  The same holds for its supporting scripts
  (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support
  script, install-sh, is <s>copyright by M.I.T.</s> but is also freely
  distributable.

  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
  covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence
  arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or
  more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has
  been removed from the free JPEG software.  (Since arithmetic coding
  provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it
  is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)  So far
  as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
  code.

  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
  files.  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF
  reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has
  been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does
  not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than
  usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

  We are required to state that
      "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the <s>Copyright property of
      CompuServe Incorporated</s>.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
      CompuServe Incorporated."

  (The LZW Patent is now void - ed.)
