          \  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory\
          \ patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License\

          \ \n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work\

          \ \n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative\
          \ Works a copy of this License; and\n \n      (b) You must cause any modified files\
          \ to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
          \ \n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n      \
          \    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution\
          \ notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that\
          \ do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n \n      (d)\
          \ If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution,\

          \ those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,\
          \ in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          \          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,\
          \ if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated\
          \ by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
          \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes\
          \ only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
          \          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n      \
          \    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that\
          \ such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying\
          \ the License.\n \n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications\
          \ and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n  \
          \    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any\
          \ such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution\
          \ of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
          \ \n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n  \
          \    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by\
          \ You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,\
          \ without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing\
          \ herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement\
          \ you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n \n  \
          \ 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,\
          \ trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required\
          \ for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and\
          \ reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n \n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless\
          \ required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the\
          \ Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\
          \      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied,\
          \ including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\
          \ MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible\
          \ for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and\
          \ assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this\
          \ License.\n \n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
          \      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless\
          \ required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts)\
          \ or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages,\
          \ including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages\
          \ of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or\
          \ inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss\
          \ of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
          \      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been\
          \ advised of the possibility of such damages.\n \n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional\
          \ Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You\
          \ may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\
          \ indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
          \      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
          \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other\
          \ Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor\
          \ harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such\
          \ Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\
          \ \n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License\
          \ to your work.\n \n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n\

      \ \n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution,\
      \ then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy\
      \ of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those\
      \ notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least\
      \ one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n    \
      \      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,\
      \ if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated\
      \ by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally\
      \ appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only\
      \ and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       \
      \   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an\

      \ attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n \n  \
      \    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide\

      \ distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole,\
      \ provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies\
      \ with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n \n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
      \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted\

      \   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms\
      \ of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding\
      \ such Contributions.\n \n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to\
      \ use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\

      \ of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n \n   7. Disclaimer of\
      \ Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor\

      AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
      \      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of\
      \ TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
      \ You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing\
      \ the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under\
      \ this License.\n \n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      \      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required\
      \ by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to\
      \ in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any\
      \ direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character\
      \ arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      \      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
      \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),\
      \ even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
      \ \n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the\
      \ Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for,\
      \ acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or\
      \ rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations,\
      \ You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      \      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and\
      \ hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
      \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional\
      \ liability.\n \n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache\
      \ License to your work.\n \n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the\
      \ following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n \
      \     replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)\
      \  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format.\
      \ We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included\
      \ on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification\
      \ within third-party archives.\n \n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n \n\

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              \   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim\
              \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution\

              \    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding\

              \ Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be\
              \ construed\n          as modifying the License.\n \n      You may add Your own\
              \ copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional\
              \ or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution\
              \ of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided\
              \ Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies\
              \ with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n \n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
              \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally\
              \ submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under\
              \ the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms\
              \ or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\
              \ or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
              \      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n \n   6. Trademarks. This\
              \ License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks,\

              \ Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides\

              \ PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness\
              \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with\
              \ Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n \n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
              \ In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence),\
              \ contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
              \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
              \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
              \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  \
              \    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work\

              \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages\
              \ or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility\
              \ of such damages.\n \n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\
              \ redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to\
              \ offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
              \      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   \
              \   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on\
              \ Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any\
              \ other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold\
              \ each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
              \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty\
              \ or additional liability.\n \n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n   APPENDIX:\
