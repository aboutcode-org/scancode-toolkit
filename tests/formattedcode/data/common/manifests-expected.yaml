      \   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an\

      \ attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n \n  \
      \    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide\
      \ additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or\
      \ distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole,\

      \ with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n \n   5. Submission of Contributions.\
      \ Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted\

      \   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms\
      \ of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding\
      \ such Contributions.\n \n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to\

      \ Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor\

      \      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of\
      \ TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
      \ You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing\
      \ the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under\
      \ this License.\n \n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      \      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required\
      \ by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to\
      \ in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any\
      \ direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character\
      \ arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      \      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage,\
      \ computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),\
      \ even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
      \ \n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the\
      \ Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for,\
      \ acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or\
      \ rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations,\
      \ You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      \      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and\
      \ hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted\
      \ against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional\
      \ liability.\n \n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache\
      \ License to your work.\n \n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the\

      \ than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display,\
      \ perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or\
      \ portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered\
      \ Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n(b) under Patent Claims infringed by\
      \ the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\
      \ and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination),\
      \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications\
      \ made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications\
      \ made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\n\
      \n(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor\
      \ first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.\n\
      \n(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any\
      \ code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements\
      \ caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination\
      \ of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the\
      \ Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered\
      \ Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution\
      \ Obligations.\n\n3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute\
      \ or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source\
      \ Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\
      \ License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code\
      \ form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform\
      \ recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain\
      \ such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium\
      \ customarily used for software exchange.\n\n3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that\
      \ You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\
      \ represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You\
      \ have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.3. Required\
      \ Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You\
      \ as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent\
      \ or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing\
      \ or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
      \n3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\
      \ Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\
      \ License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\
      \ fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients\
      \ of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\
      \ of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that\
      \ any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\
      \ and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\
      \ liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\
      \ support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable\
      \ Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms\
      \ of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\
      \ different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this\
      \ License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter\
      \ the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License.\
      \ If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license,\
      \ You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are\
      \ offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree\
      \ to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\
      \ by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
      \n3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other\
      \ code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\
      \ product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled\
      \ for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems,\
      \ Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this\
      \ License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
      \ Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right\
      \ to modify this License.\n\n4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,\
      \ distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\
      \ of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\
      \ Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed\
      \ or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute\
      \ and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License\
      \ under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\
      \ to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms\
      \ of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified\
      \ Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\
      \ Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if\
      \ You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward\
      \ (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make\
      \ it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER\
      \ OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT\
      \ WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\
      \ THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\
      \ OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED\
      \ SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU\
      \ (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\
      \ SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL\
      \ PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT\
      \ UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n6.1. This License and the rights granted\
      \ hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail\
      \ to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which,\
      \ by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall\
      \ survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment\
      \ actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor\
      \ against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the\
      \ Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\
      \ or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\
      \ indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly\
      \ to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the\
      \ Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,\
      \ upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\
      \ expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw\
      \ Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either\
      \ unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event\
      \ of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been\
      \ validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding\
      \ licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION\
      \ OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\
      \ NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,\
      \ OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\
      \ TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\
      \ CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL,\
      \ WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\
      \ OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
      \ THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\
      \ RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.\
      \ SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\
      \ DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT\
      \ END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48\
      \ C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is\
      \ defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation\
      \ as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212\
      \ and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\
      \ acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government\
      \ Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\
      \ provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\
      \n9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\
      \ matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision\
      \ shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License\
      \ shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\
      \ the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),\
      \ excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\
      \ this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction\
      \ and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\
      \ party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable\
      \ attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts\
      \ for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which\
      \ provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall\
      \ not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with\
      \ the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\
      \ regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available\
      \ any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer\
      \ and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly\
      \ or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\
      \ work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an\
      \ equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\
      \ of liability.\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\
      \ LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\
      \ State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating\
      \ to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\
      \ District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying\
      \ in Santa Clara County, California."

    text: "                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version\
      \ 3, 29 June 2007\n \n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\
      \ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document,\
      \ but changing it is not allowed.\n \n\n  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public\
      \ License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\n\
      License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n \n  0. Additional\
      \ Definitions.\n \n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\n\
      General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public\
      \ License.\n \n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n\
      other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n \n  An \"Application\"\
      \ is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not\
      \ otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library\
      \ is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n \n  A \"Combined\
      \ Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.\
      \  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also\
      \ called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n \n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined\
      \ Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n\
      for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application,\
      \ and not on the Linked Version.\n \n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined\
      \ Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n\
      and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but\
      \ excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n \n  1. Exception to Section 3\
      \ of the GNU GPL.\n \n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n\
      without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n \n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\
      \ \n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers\
      \ to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other\
      \ than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy\
      \ of the modified\nversion:\n \n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good\
      \ faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n \
      \  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its\
      \ purpose remains meaningful, or\n \n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional\
      \ permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n \n  3. Object Code Incorporating\
      \ Material from Library Header Files.\n \n  The object code form of an Application may\
      \ incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey\
      \ such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial\
      \ is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small\
      \ macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both\
      \ of the following:\n \n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code\
      \ that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered\
      \ by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and\
      \ this license\n   document.\n \n  4. Combined Works.\n \n  You may convey a Combined\
      \ Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification\
      \ of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering\
      \ for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n \n   a) Give\
      \ prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in\
      \ it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n \n   b) Accompany\
      \ the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n \n   c)\
      \ For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the\
      \ copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing\
      \ the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n \n   d) Do one\
      \ of the following:\n \n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms\
      \ of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable\
      \ for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application\
      \ with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined\
      \ Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n  \
      \     Corresponding Source.\n \n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for\
      \ linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run\
      \ time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system,\
      \ and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is\
      \ interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n \n   e) Provide Installation\
      \ Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information\
      \ under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n\
      \   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced\
      \ by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked\
      \ Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n \
      \  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use\
      \ option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified\
      \ by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n \n  5. Combined\
      \ Libraries.\n \n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary\
      \ side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not\
      \ Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library\
      \ under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n \n   a) Accompany the\
      \ combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with\
      \ any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n \n   b)\
      \ Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based\
      \ on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of\
      \ the same work.\n \n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\
      \ \n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU\
      \ Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar\
      \ in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems\
      \ or concerns.\n \n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary\
      \ as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General\
      \ Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following\
      \ the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\n\
      published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not\
      \ specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any\
      \ version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software\
      \ Foundation.\n \n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\n\
      whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's\
      \ public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to\
      \ choose that version for the\nLibrary."
