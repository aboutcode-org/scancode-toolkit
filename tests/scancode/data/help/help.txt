  output filters:
    --ignore-author <pattern>       Ignore findings with an author matching
                                    <pattern>. Note that this will ignore a file
                                    even if it has other scanned data such as a
                                    license or errors.
    --ignore-copyright-holder <pattern>
                                    Ignore findings with a copyright holder
                                    matching <pattern>. Note that this will ignore
                                    a file even if it has other scanned data such
                                    as a license or errors.
    --only-findings                 Only return files or directories with findings
                                    for the requested scans. Files and directories
                                    without findings are omitted (file information
                                    is not treated as findings).

  output control:
    --full-root   Report full, absolute paths. The default is to always include
                  the last directory segment of the scanned path such that all
                  paths have a common root directory.
    --strip-root  Strip the root directory segment of all paths. The default is to
                  always include the last directory segment of the scanned path
                  such that all paths have a common root directory.

  pre-scan:
    --facet <facet>:<pattern>  Add the <facet> to files matching <pattern>.
    --ignore <pattern>         Ignore files matching <pattern>.

  post-scan:
    --copyright-summary             Summarize copyrights, holders and authors at
                                    the file and directory level.
    --license-policy FILE           Load a License Policy file and apply it to the
                                    scan at the Resource level.
    --license-summary               Summarize license expressions at the file and
                                    directory level.Requires license_expression.
    --mark-source                   Set the "is_source" to true for directories
                                    that contain over 90% of source files as
                                    children and descendants. Count the number of
                                    source files in a directory as a new
                                    source_file_counts attribute
    --programming-language-summary  Summarize programming languages  at the file
                                    and directory level.Requires info.

  core:
    --timeout <secs>         Stop an unfinished file scan after a timeout in
                             seconds.  [default: 120 seconds]
    -n, --processes INT      Set the number of parallel processes to use. Disable
                             parallel processing if 0. Also disable threading if
                             -1. [default: 1]
    --quiet                  Do not print summary or progress.
    --verbose                Print progress as file-by-file path instead of a
                             progress bar. Print a verbose scan summary.
    --from-json              Load codebase from an existing JSON scan
    --cache-dir DIR          Set the path to an existing directory where ScanCode
                             can cache files available across runs.If not set, the
                             value of the `SCANCODE_CACHE` environment variable is
                             used if available. If `SCANCODE_CACHE` is not set, a
                             default sub-directory in the user home directory is
                             used instead. [default: ~/.cache/scancode-tk/version]
    --temp-dir DIR           Set the path to an existing directory where ScanCode
                             can create temporary files. If not set, the value of
                             the `SCANCODE_TMP` environment variable is used if
                             available. If `SCANCODE_TMP` is not set, a default
                             sub-directory in the system temp directory is used
                             instead.  [default: TMP/scancode-tk-<key>]
    --timing                 Collect scan timing for each scan/scanned file.
    --max-in-memory INTEGER  Maximum number of files and directories scan details
                             kept in memory during a scan. Additional files and
                             directories scan details above this number are cached
                             on-disk rather than in memory. Use 0 to use unlimited
                             memory and disable on-disk caching. Use -1 to use
                             only on-disk caching.  [default: 10000]

  miscellaneous:
    --reindex-licenses  Check the license index cache and reindex if needed and
                        exit.
    --test-mode         Run ScanCode in a special "test mode". Only for testing.

  documentation:
    -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
    --about          Show information about ScanCode and licensing and exit.
    --version        Show the version and exit.
    --examples       Show command examples and exit.
    --plugins        Show the list of available ScanCode plugins and exit.
    --print-options  Show the list of selected options and exit. (used in debug
                     only)

  Examples (use --examples for more):

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights.
  Save scan results to the 'scancode_result.json' JSON file:

      scancode --license --copyright --json=scancode_result.json samples

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and package manifests. Print scan
  results on screen as pretty-formatted JSON (using the special '-' FILE to print
  to on screen/to stdout):

      scancode --json-pp - --license --package  samples

  Note: when you run scancode, a progress bar is displayed with a counter of
  the number of files processed. Use --verbose to display file-by-file
  progress.
