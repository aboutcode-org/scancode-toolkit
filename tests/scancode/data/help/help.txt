                            running the --info scan.

  output filters:
    --only-findings  Only return files or directories with findings for the
                     requested scans. Files and directories without findings are
                     omitted (file information is not treated as findings).

  output control:
    --full-root   Report full, absolute paths. The default is to always include
                  the last directory segment of the scanned path such that all
                  paths have a common root directory.
    --strip-root  Strip the root directory segment of all paths. The default is to
                  always include the last directory segment of the scanned path
                  such that all paths have a common root directory.

  pre-scan:
    --ignore <pattern>  Ignore files matching <pattern>.

  post-scan:
    --mark-source  Set the "is_source" to true for directories that contain over
                   90% of source files as children and descendants. Implies
                   running the --info scan.

  core:
    --timeout <secs>     Stop an unfinished file scan after a timeout in seconds.
                         [default: 120 seconds]
    -n, --processes INT  Set the number of parallel processes to use. Disable
                         parallel processing if 0. Also disable threading if -1.
                         [default: 1]
    --quiet              Do not print summary or progress.
    --verbose            Print progress  as file-by-file path instead of a
                         progress bar. Print a verbose scan summary.
    --cache-dir DIR      Set the path to an existing directory where ScanCode can
                         cache files available across runs.If not set, the value
                         of the `SCANCODE_CACHE` environment variable is used if
                         available. If `SCANCODE_CACHE` is not set, a default sub-
                         directory in the user home directory is used instead.
                         [default: ~/.cache/scancode-tk/version]
    --temp-dir DIR       Set the path to an existing directory where ScanCode can
                         create temporary files. If not set, the value of the
                         `SCANCODE_TMP` environment variable is used if available.
                         If `SCANCODE_TMP` is not set, a default sub-directory in
                         the system temp directory is used instead.  [default: TMP
                         /scancode-tk-<key>]
    --timing             Collect scan timing for each scan/scanned file.
    --on-disk-results    Save intermediate scan results in temporary files. Uses
                         less memory.  [default: True]

  miscellaneous:
    --reindex-licenses  Check the license index cache and reindex if needed and
                        exit.
    --test-mode         Run ScanCode in a special "test mode". Only for testing.

  documentation:
    -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
    --about     Show information about ScanCode and licensing and exit.
    --version   Show the version and exit.
    --examples  Show command examples and exit.
    --plugins   Show the list of available ScanCode plugins and exit.

  Examples (use --examples for more):

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights.
  Save scan results to the 'scancode_result.json' JSON file:

      scancode --license --copyright --json=scancode_result.json samples

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and package manifests. Print scan
  results on screen as pretty-formatted JSON (using the special '-' FILE to print
  to on screen/to stdout):

      scancode --json-pp - --license --package  samples

  Note: when you run scancode, a progress bar is displayed with a counter of
  the number of files processed. Use --verbose to display file-by-file
  progress.
