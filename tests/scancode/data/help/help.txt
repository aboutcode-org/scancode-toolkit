  scan options:
    --license-diagnostics        In license detections, include diagnostic details
                                 to figure out the license detection post
                                 processing steps applied.

  output filters:
    --ignore-author <pattern>       Ignore a file (and all its findings) if an
                                    author contains a match to the <pattern>
                                    regular expression. Note that this will ignore
                                    a file even if it has other findings such as a
                                    license or errors.
    --ignore-copyright-holder <pattern>
                                    Ignore a file (and all its findings) if a
                                    copyright holder contains a match to the
                                    <pattern> regular expression. Note that this
                                    will ignore a file even if it has other
                                    scanned data such as a license or errors.
    --only-findings                 Only return files or directories with findings
                                    for the requested scans. Files and directories
                                    without findings are omitted (file information
                                    is not treated as findings).

  output control:
    --full-root   Report full, absolute paths.
    --strip-root  Strip the root directory segment of all paths. The default is to
                  always include the last directory segment of the scanned path
                  such that all paths have a common root directory.

  pre-scan:
    --ignore <pattern>         Ignore files matching <pattern>.
    --include <pattern>        Include files matching <pattern>.
    --facet <facet>=<pattern>  Add the <facet> to files with a path matching
                               <pattern>.

  post-scan:
    --classify               Classify files with flags telling if the file is a
                             legal, or readme or test file, etc.
    --consolidate            Group resources by Packages or license and copyright
                             holder and return those groupings as a list of
                             consolidated packages and a list of consolidated
                             components. This requires the scan to have/be run
                             with the copyright, license, and package options
                             active
    --filter-clues           Filter redundant duplicated clues already contained
                             in detected license and copyright texts and notices.
    --license-clarity-score  Compute a summary license clarity score at the
                             codebase level.
    --license-policy FILE    Load a License Policy file and apply it to the scan
                             at the Resource level.
    --license-references     Return reference data for all licenses and license
                             rules present in detections.
    --mark-source            Set the "is_source" to true for directories that
                             contain over 90% of source files as children and
                             descendants. Count the number of source files in a
                             directory as a new source_file_counts attribute
    --summary                Summarize scans by providing declared origin
                             information and other detected origin info at the
                             codebase attribute level.
    --tallies                Compute tallies for license, copyright and other

                             scans and group the results by facet.
    --tallies-key-files      Compute tallies for license, copyright and other
                             scans for key, top-level files. Key files are top-

                             package manifests as reported by the --classify
                             option "is_legal", "is_readme", "is_manifest" and
                             "is_top_level" flags.
    --tallies-with-details   Compute tallies of license, copyright and other scans
                             at the codebase level, keeping intermediate details
                             at the file and directory level.
    --todo                   Summarize scans by providing all ambiguous detections
                             which are todo items and needs manual review.

  core:
    --timeout <seconds>      Stop an unfinished file scan after a timeout in
                             seconds. [default: 120 seconds]
    -n, --processes INT      Set the number of parallel processes to use. Disable
                             parallel processing if 0. Also disable threading if
                             -1. [default: 1]
    -q, --quiet              Do not print summary or progress.
    -v, --verbose            Print progress as file-by-file path instead of a
                             progress bar. Print verbose scan counters.
    --from-json              Load codebase from one or more <input> JSON scan
                             file(s).
    --max-in-memory INTEGER  Maximum number of files and directories scan details
                             kept in memory during a scan. Additional files and
                             directories scan details above this number are cached
                             on-disk rather than in memory. Use 0 to use unlimited
                             memory and disable on-disk caching. Use -1 to use
                             only on-disk caching.  [default: 10000]
    --max-depth INTEGER      Maximum nesting depth of subdirectories to scan.
                             Descend at most INTEGER levels of directories below
                             and including the starting directory. Use 0 for no
                             scan depth limit.

  Examples (use --examples for more):

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights.
  Save scan results to the 'scancode_result.json' JSON file:

      scancode --license --copyright --json-pp scancode_result.json samples

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and package manifests. Print scan
  results on screen as pretty-formatted JSON (using the special '-' FILE to print
  to on screen/to stdout):

      scancode --json-pp - --license --package  samples

  Note: when you run scancode, a progress bar is displayed with a counter of the
  number of files processed. Use --verbose to display file-by-file progress.
