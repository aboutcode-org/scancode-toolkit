  output filters:
    --ignore-author <pattern>       Ignore a file (and all its findings) if an
                                    author contains a match to the <pattern>
                                    regular expression. Note that this will ignore
                                    a file even if it has other findings such as a
                                    license or errors.
    --ignore-copyright-holder <pattern>
                                    Ignore a file (and all its findings) if a
                                    copyright holder contains a match to the
                                    <pattern> regular expression. Note that this
                                    will ignore a file even if it has other
                                    scanned data such as a license or errors.
    --only-findings                 Only return files or directories with findings
                                    for the requested scans. Files and directories
                                    without findings are omitted (file information
                                    is not treated as findings).

  output control:
    --full-root   Report full, absolute paths.
    --strip-root  Strip the root directory segment of all paths. The default is to
                  always include the last directory segment of the scanned path
                  such that all paths have a common root directory.

  pre-scan:
    --ignore <pattern>         Ignore files matching <pattern>.
    --classify                 Classify files with flags telling if the file is a
                               legal, or readme or test file, etc.
    --facet <facet>=<pattern>  Add the <facet> to files with a path matching
                               <pattern>.

  post-scan:
    --license-clarity-score  Compute a summary license clarity score at the
                             codebase level.
    --license-policy FILE    Load a License Policy file and apply it to the scan
                             at the Resource level.
    --mark-source            Set the "is_source" to true for directories that
                             contain over 90% of source files as children and
                             descendants. Count the number of source files in a
                             directory as a new source_file_counts attribute
    --summary                Summarize license, copyright and other scans at the
                             codebase level.
    --summary-by-facet       Summarize license, copyright and other scans and
                             group the results by facet.
    --summary-key-files      Summarize license, copyright and other scans for key,
                             top-level files. Key files are top-level codebase
                             files such as COPYING, README and package manifests
                             as reported by the --classify option "is_legal",
                             "is_readme", "is_manifest" and "is_top_level" flags.
    --summary-with-details   Summarize license, copyright and other scans at the
                             codebase level, keeping intermediate details at the
                             file and directory level.

  core:
    --timeout <secs>         Stop an unfinished file scan after a timeout in
                             seconds.  [default: 120 seconds]
    -n, --processes INT      Set the number of parallel processes to use. Disable
                             parallel processing if 0. Also disable threading if
                             -1. [default: 1]
    --quiet                  Do not print summary or progress.
    --verbose                Print progress as file-by-file path instead of a

    --timing                 Collect scan timing for each scan/scanned file.
    --max-in-memory INTEGER  Maximum number of files and directories scan details
                             kept in memory during a scan. Additional files and
                             directories scan details above this number are cached
                             on-disk rather than in memory. Use 0 to use unlimited
                             memory and disable on-disk caching. Use -1 to use
                             only on-disk caching.  [default: 10000]

  miscellaneous:
    --reindex-licenses  Check the license index cache and reindex if needed and
                        exit.
    --keep-temp-files   Keep temporary files and show the directory where
                        temporary files are stored. (By default temporary files
                        are deleted when a scan is completed.
    --test-mode         Run ScanCode in a special "test mode". Only for testing.

  documentation:
    -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
    --about          Show information about ScanCode and licensing and exit.

    --print-options  Show the list of selected options and exit.

  Examples (use --examples for more):

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights.
  Save scan results to the 'scancode_result.json' JSON file:

      scancode --license --copyright --json=scancode_result.json samples

  Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and package manifests. Print scan
  results on screen as pretty-formatted JSON (using the special '-' FILE to print
  to on screen/to stdout):

      scancode --json-pp - --license --package  samples

  Note: when you run scancode, a progress bar is displayed with a counter of
  the number of files processed. Use --verbose to display file-by-file
  progress.
