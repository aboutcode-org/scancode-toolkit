    Find longest matching block of a and b in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

    `b2j` is a mapping of b high token ids -> list of position in b
    `len_good` is such that token ids smaller than `_good_good` are treated as
    good, non-junk tokens. `matchables` is a set of matchable positions.
    Positions absent from this set are ignored.

    Return (i,j,k) Match tuple where:
        "i" in the start in "a"
        "j" in the start in "b"
        "k" in the size of the match

    and such that a[i:i+k] is equal to b[j:j+k], where
        alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi
        blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi

        k >= k'
        i <= i'
        and if i == i', j <= j'

    In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that starts
    earliest in a, and of all those maximal matching blocks that start earliest
    in a, return the one that starts earliest in b.

    First the longest matching block (aka contiguous substring) is determined
    where no junk element appears in the block. Then that block is extended as
    far as possible by matching other tokens including junk on both sides. So
    the resulting block never matches on junk.

    If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).
