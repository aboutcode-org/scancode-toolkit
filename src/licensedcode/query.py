"""
Build license queries from scanned files to feed the detection pipeline.

A query is a sequence of tokens.
Queries are further broken down in query runs that are "slices" of a query.

Several heuristics are used to break down a query in query runs and this process
is important to the overall speed and accuracy of license detection: since the
most costly parts of detection is done query run by query run, and sequence
alignment is performed on the best ranking candidates from a probalistic
ranking, the defintion of what chunk should be matched matters a lot.

If too small, chunking would favour alignment against smaller rules and increase
the processing time as more alignments would need to be computed. If too big,
chunking would eschew alignment against smaller rules.

So based on the chunk size, the alignment may be stuck on working with a
suboptimal set of candidate rules yielding possibly matches that are too small
and scattered to make sense when matches are merged.

If chunks are bigger, this decreases the sensitivity to more specific smaller
rules and would mistakenly report licenses that may contain the text of other
smaller licenses instead of larger longer licenses. But this does speed up
detection as fewer alignments need to be computed.

So rather than breaking the queries using a single way for all queries, we
compute crude statistics on the query text "structure" using the counts of
lines, the fact a text file has very long lines, empty lines, lines with unknown
tokens, lines with junk tokens and decide how to break a query based on these.

For instance, some HTML or code file may be very sparse and their source have a
lot of empty lines. However, this is is most often due to the original text
having been transformed when encoded as HTML or an artifact of some generated
HTML or HTML editor. When we can detect these, we can eventually ignore
heuristics to break queries based on sequences of empty lines. (Note this is not
yet implemented for HTML).

Conversely, a file text could be very dense and may contain a single line or
only a few lines of text as can happen with minified JavaScript. In these cases
counting lines is useless and other heuristic are needed.
