"""
Build license queries from scanned files to feed the detection pipeline.

A query is a sequence of tokens.
Queries are further broken down in query runs that are "slices" of a query.

Several heuristics are used to break down a query in query runs and this process is
important to the overall speed and accuracy of license detection: since the most
costly parts of detection is done query run by query run, and sequence alignment is
performed on the best ranking candidates from a probalistic ranking, the defintion of
what chunk should be matched matters a lot.

If too small, chunking would favour alignment against smaller rules and increase the
processing time as more alignments would need to be computed. If too big, chunking
would eschew alignment against smaller rules.

So based on the chunk side, the alignment may be stuck on working with a suboptimal
set of candidate rules yielding possibly matches that are too small and scattered to
make sense when matches are merged.

If chunks are bigger, this decreases the sensitivity to more specific smaller rules
and would mistakenly report licenses that may contain the text of other smaller
licenses instead of larger longer licenses. But this does speed up detection as fewer
alignments need to be compued. So rather than breaking the queries using a single way
for all queries, we compute crude statistics on the query text "structure" using the
counts of lines, empty lines, lines with unknown tokens, lines with junk tokens and
decide how to break a query based on these.

For instance, some HTML or code file may be very sparse and their source have a lot
of empty lines. However, this is is most often due to the original text having been
transformed when encoded as HTML or an artifact of some generated HTML or HTML
editor. When we can detect these, we can eventually ignore heuristics to break
queries based on sequences of empty lines. (Note this is not yet implemented for
HTML).

Conversely, a file text could be very dense and may contain a single line or only a
few lines of text as can happen with minified JavaScript. In these cases counting
lines is useless and other heuristic are needed.
