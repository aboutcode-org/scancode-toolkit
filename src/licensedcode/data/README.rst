ScanCode license data
=====================

ScanCode license detection is about finding common texts between the text of a query file
being scanned and the texts of the indexed license texts and rule texts.

This package contains the data (possibly compressed and pickled depending on how it is packaged)
of  all rules and licenses used by ScanCode
