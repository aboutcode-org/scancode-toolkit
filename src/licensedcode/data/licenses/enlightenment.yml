notes: Per Fedora, this license is a modified version of the common MIT license, with an additional
    advertising clause that makes it GPL-incompatible. It was originally found at http://www.enlightenment.org/viewvc/e16/e/COPYING?revision=1.10
    , but that URL is gone (they seem to have moved source control systems). The latest available
    copy from enlightment.org http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk/E16/e/COPYING has
    been preserved here for reference.
