In addition, you must treat the Software and Documentation as strictly confidential and you must use the same care to protect it from unauthorized use, access or disclosure as you use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information, but never less than the care a reasonable person would use under similar circumstances. Any breach of this Section 8 would cause irreparable injury to BROADCOM for which no adequate remedy at law exists. Therefore, you agree that equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and specific performance, are appropriate remedies to redress any breach or threatened breach of this Section 8, in addition to all other remedies available to BROADCOM.

You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, whether by agreement, operation of law or otherwise, any right or obligation hereunder without the express prior written consent of BROADCOM, and any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void.
