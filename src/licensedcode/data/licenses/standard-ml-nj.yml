notes: per SPDX.org, SPDX ended up with this license on the license list twice once as of v1.17
    with the short identifier SMLNJ and then added (again) as of v1.20 with the short identifier
    StandardML-NJ. The former list entry has been deprecated. Here, this license is not verbatim
    the SPDX SMLMJ, but instead the more generic variant as used in the Java CUP parser generator
    that has no specific references to Lucent and Bell Labs and is therefore a better choice
    for reuse.
