BitTorrent, Inc. reserves all rights in the Software not expressly granted to you here.

The BitTorrent Technologies
Downloading and Updates

The Software downloads only those files that are both authorized by you for download (specifically or by category or subscription), except that the Software automatically updates itself.

Automatic Uploading

The Software accelerates downloads by enabling your computer to grab pieces of files from other BitTorrent users simultaneously. Your use of the Software to download files will, in turn, enable other users to download pieces of those files from you, thereby maximizing download speeds for all users. In the Software, only files that you are explicitly downloading or sharing or have downloaded or shared through BitTorrent will be made available to others. You consent to other users' use of your network connection to download portions of such files from you. At any time, you may uninstall the Software through the Add/Remove Programs control panel utility. In addition, for the BitTorrent or uTorrent software, you can control the Software in multiple ways through its user interface without affecting any files you have already downloaded.

Disclaimer of Warranty
BitTorrent, Inc. disclaims any responsibility for harm resulting from the Software or any software or content downloaded using the Software, whether or not BitTorrent, Inc. approved such software or content. BitTorrent, Inc. approval does not guarantee that software or content from an approved partner will function, sound, or appear as offered or hoped, or be complete, accurate, or free from bugs, errors, viruses, or other harmful content. BitTorrent, Inc expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, including any implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement, and any warranties and conditions arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade regarding the Software or any software or content you download using the Software. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from BitTorrent, Inc or elsewhere will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in this agreement. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitation may not apply to you to its full extent.

Limitation of Liability
BitTorrent, Inc's total liability to you from all causes of action and under all theories of liability will be limited to $50.00. In no event and under no theory of liability will BitTorrent, Inc be liable to you for any special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the software whether or not BitTorrent, Inc has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations will survive even if any limited remedy specified is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you to its full extent.
