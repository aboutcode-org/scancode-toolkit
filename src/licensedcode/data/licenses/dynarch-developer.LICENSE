Definitions of terms

    "PRODUCT" refers to the product offered by Dynarch.com (the object of this license agreement).
    "LICENSEE" refers to the one that has downloaded the PRODUCT package. Sometimes we might use "you" as a synonym.

Other terms that might be used

    "Application", "Software Application" or "Web Application": will refer to an application developed by the LICENSEE. An Application has a finite scope.
    "Library", "Software Library": refers to a possibly reusable collection of tools intended to help developers build Applications.

Here is an example to make clear the distinction between an Application and a Library: the Opera Web Browser is an Application built on top of the Qt Toolkit. While Opera has a finite scope (it is a Web browser), Qt is also used in a lot of other applications, for instance the KDE Desktop. Qt is a Library for developers, while Opera is a general audience Application.
