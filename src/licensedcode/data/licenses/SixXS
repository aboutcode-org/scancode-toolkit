AICCU LICENSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the quick reader this is a slightly modified BSD license:
 - names changed from Regents/University to SixXS.
 - point 3 -'written', for us an email will suffice.
 - point 4 and 5 added.

Basically we thus allow anybody to use it in any way, but we would like
to be notified when you are using it for not connecting to SixXS.
The meaning of 'SHOULD' is described in IETF's RFC 2119 / BCP 14.
