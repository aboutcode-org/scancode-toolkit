    GPL + java exception
    While it may be redundant, just for clarity the GPL'ed code included within
    I2PTunnel and other apps must be released under the GPL with an additional
    "exception" explicitly authorizing the use of Java's standard libraries:
    In addition, as a special exception, XXXX gives permission to link the code
    of this program with the proprietary Java implementation provided by Sun
    (or other vendors as well), and distribute linked combinations including
    the two. You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for
    all of the code used other than the proprietary Java implementation. If you
    modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
    delete this exception statement from your version.
    All source code under each component will by default be licensed under the
    primary license, unless marked otherwise in the code. All of the above is
    summary of the license terms - please see the specific license for the
    component or source code in question for authoritative terms. Component
    source locations and resource packaging may be changed if the repository is
    reorganized.
