8.	INDEMNIFICATION

(ii) nexB has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, and
(iii) Licensee provides nexB with the assistance, information, and authority necessary to perform the above.

(b)	nexB will have no liability for any claim of infringement based on:
(i) code contained within the Software which was not created by nexB including, but not limited to, the third-party software or Open Source Software;
(ii) use of a superseded or altered release of the Software, except for such alteration(s) or modification(s) which have been made by nexB or under nexB's direction, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current, unaltered release of the Software that nexB provides to Licensee, or
(iii) the combination, operation, or use of any Software furnished under this Agreement with programs or data not furnished by nexB if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software without such programs or data.
