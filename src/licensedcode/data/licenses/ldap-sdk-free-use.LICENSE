UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License

THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU ("YOU") AND UNBOUNDID CORP. ("UNBOUNDID")
REGARDING YOUR USE OF UNBOUNDID LDAP SDK FOR JAVA AND ANY ASSOCIATED
DOCUMENTATION, OBJECT CODE, COMPILED LIBRARIES, SOURCE CODE AND SOURCE FILES OR
OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE BY UNBOUNDID (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO IN THIS
AGREEMENT AS THE ("SDK").

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT
INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK.

USE OF THE SDK.  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, UnboundID
grants to You a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under UnboundID's
intellectual property rights in the SDK, to use, reproduce, modify and
distribute this release of the SDK; provided that no license is granted herein
under any patents that may be infringed by your modifications, derivative works
or by other works in which the SDK may be incorporated (collectively, your
"Applications").  You may reproduce and redistribute the SDK with your
Applications provided that you (i) include this license file and an
unmodified copy of the unboundid-ldapsdk-se.jar file; and (ii) such
redistribution is subject to a license whose terms do not conflict with or
contradict the terms of this Agreement. You may also reproduce and redistribute
the SDK without your Applications provided that you redistribute the SDK
complete and unmodified (i.e., with all "read me" files, copyright notices, and
other legal notices and terms that UnboundID has included in the SDK).

SCOPE OF LICENSES.  This Agreement does not grant You the right to use any
UnboundID intellectual property which is not included as part of the SDK.  The
SDK is licensed, not sold.  This Agreement only gives You some rights to use
the SDK.  UnboundID reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives You
more rights despite this limitation, You may use the SDK only as expressly
permitted in this Agreement.

SUPPORT.  UnboundID is not obligated to provide any technical or other support
("Support Services") for the SDK to You under this Agreement. However, if
UnboundID chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of such
Support Services will be governed by then-current UnboundID support policies.

TERMINATION.  UnboundID reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK and
to modify the SDK at any time in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, UnboundID may also, in its sole
discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK to You or any end user at
any time.  In addition, if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,
then any rights granted herein will be automatically terminated if such failure
is not corrected within 30 days of the initial notification of such failure.
You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a
sufficient remedy if You breach this Agreement and that UnboundID will be
entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or
equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction
in the event of a breach.  UnboundID may also terminate this Agreement if the
SDK becomes, or in UnboundID?s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the
subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation.  All rights and licenses granted herein will simultaneously
and automatically terminate upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND UNBOUNDID DOES NOT
WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, WILL PERFORM IN AN
UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR TIMELY MANNER, OR WILL INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER
HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ALL
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF UNBOUNDID HAD BEEN
INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS ARE HEREBY
DISCLAIMED.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL UNBOUNDID OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS,
REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COST OF COVER, DIRECT,
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND)
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNBOUNDID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.  Certain states do not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties or limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so the
exclusion of limited warranties and limitation of liability set forth above may
not apply to You.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The SDK is subject to United States export control laws.
You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for compliance with all
domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the SDK.

MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement with respect to
the SDK.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. This
Agreement and performance hereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict
of laws rules.  Any disputes related to this Agreement shall be exclusively
litigated in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.
