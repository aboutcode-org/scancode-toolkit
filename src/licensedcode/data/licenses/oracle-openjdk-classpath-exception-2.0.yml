    "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
    Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates
    are
    subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL,
    but
    only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's

    the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the
    "Classpath"
    exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this
    code."
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.
