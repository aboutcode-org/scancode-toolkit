notes: Per Fedora, this license is the same as zlib, except that it requires that an acknowledgement
    be made in the product documentation. For Fedora, this is our Release notes, so if you have
    any packages which use this license, you MUST be sure to have the appropriate acknowledgement
    in the release notes.
