If You wish to provide Intel with information that You intend to be treated as confidential information, Intel requires that such confidential information be provided pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), so please contact Your Intel representative to ensure the proper NDA is in place.

Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from reviewing Your Communications and errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing Your Communications. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from implementing independently- developed enhancements to Intel’s own error diagnosis methodology to detect errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing Your Communications or to implement bug fixes or enhancements in Intel products. The foregoing may include the right to include Your Communications in regression test suites.

10.	NON-DISCLOSURE: The following provisions will apply if there is no existing non-disclosure agreement between You and Intel. You will maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information (if any) with at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. You will not disclose the Confidential Information to any employees or to any third parties except to Your employees who have a need to know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as those set forth herein; provided that You will be liable for breach by any such entity. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “employee” will include Your independent contractors, who have signed confidentiality agreements with You. You will not make any copies of the Confidential Information except as necessary for Your employees with a need to know.
