Both Adobe and its auditors shall execute a commercially reasonable non-disclosure agreement with Licensee before proceeding with the verification. If such verification shows that Licensee is using a greater number of copies of the SDK Components than that legitimately licensed, or are deploying or using the SDK Components in any way not permitted under this Agreement and which would require additional license fees, Licensee shall pay the applicable fees for such additional copies within thirty (30) days of invoice date, with such underpaid fees being the license fees as per Adobe’s then-current, country specific, license fee list.
