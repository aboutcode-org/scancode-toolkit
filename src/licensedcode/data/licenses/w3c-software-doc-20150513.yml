notes: |
    Previous version was http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
    This version makes clear that the license is applicable to both software and
    text, by changing the name and substituting "work" for instances of "software
    and its documentation." It moves "notice of changes or modifications to the
    files" to the copyright notice, to make clear that the license is compatible
    with other liberal licenses.
    There is also a short notice version at https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-short-notice.html
