notes: Previous version was http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
    This version makes clear that the license is applicable to both software and text, by changing
    the name and substituting "work" for instances of "software and its documentation." It moves
    "notice of changes or modifications to the files" to the copyright notice, to make clear
    that the license is compatible with other liberal licenses. There is also a short notice
    version at https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-short-notice.html
