BigScience RAIL License v1.0
dated May 19, 2022

This is a license (the “License”) between you (“You”) and the participants of BigScience (“Licensor”). Whereas the Apache 2.0 license was applicable to resources used to develop the Model, the licensing conditions have been modified for the access and distribution of the Model. This has been done to further BigScience’s aims of promoting not just open-access to its artifacts, but also a responsible use of these artifacts. Therefore, this Responsible AI License (RAIL)[1] aims at having an open and permissive character while striving for responsible use of the Model.


                                                                    Section  I:  PREAMBLE


BigScience is a collaborative open innovation project aimed at the responsible development and use of large multilingual datasets and Large Language Models (“LLM”), as well as, the documentation of best practices and tools stemming from this collaborative effort. Further, BigScience participants wish to promote collaboration and sharing of research artifacts - including the Model - for the benefit of society, pursuant to this License.


The development and use of LLMs, and broadly artificial intelligence (“AI”), does not come without concerns. The world has witnessed how just a few companies/institutions are able to develop LLMs, and moreover, how Natural Language Processing techniques might, in some instances, become a risk for the public in general. Concerns might come in many forms, from racial discrimination to the treatment of sensitive information. 


BigScience believes in the intersection between open and responsible AI development, thus, this License aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science for large language models and future NLP techniques. 
This License governs the use of the BigScience BLOOM models (and their derivatives) and is informed by both the BigScience Ethical Charter and the model cards associated with the BigScience BLOOM models. BigScience has set forth its Ethical Charter representing the values of  its community. Although the BigScience community does not aim to impose its values on potential users of this Model, it is determined to take tangible steps towards protecting the community from inappropriate uses of the work being developed by BigScience.
Furthermore, the model cards for the BigScience BLOOM models will inform the user about the limitations of the Model, and thus serves as the basis of some of the use-based restrictions in this License (See Part II).

NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:

1. Definitions 


1. "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document.
2. “Data” means a collection of texts extracted from the BigScience Corpus used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License. The BigScience Corpus is a collection of existing sources of language data documented on the BigScience website.
3. “Output” means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.
4. “Model” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the BigScience BLOOM model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part, on the Data using the Complementary Material. 
5. “Derivatives of the Model” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model.
6. “Complementary Material” shall mean the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples etc.
7. “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access. 
8. “Licensor” means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License, including the persons or entities that may have rights in the Model and/or distributing the Model.
9. "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator.
10. “Third Parties” means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.
11. "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and any modifications or additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
12. "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Model.


                                              Section II:   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Model to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or Complementary Material or a Contribution incorporated within the Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
