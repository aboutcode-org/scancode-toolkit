MySQL FOSS License Exception

We want free and open source software applications under certain licenses to be able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL Connector (specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries) despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, which are identified and described in more detail in the FOSS License Exception at <http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>
