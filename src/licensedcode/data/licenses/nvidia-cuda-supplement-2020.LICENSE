------------
PCRE LICENCE
------------
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" 
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also 
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are 
both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.
