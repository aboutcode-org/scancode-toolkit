This end user license agreement (“EULA”) governs the use of the JBoss
Enterprise Middleware and any related updates, source code, appearance,
structure and organization (the “Programs”), regardless of the delivery
mechanism.

1. License Grant. Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. (“Red
Hat”) grants to you a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs (each
of which may include multiple software components) pursuant to the GNU
Lesser General Public License v. 2.1. With the exception of certain
image files identified in Section 2 below, each software component is
governed by a license that permits you to run, copy, modify, and
redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software
component. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not limit
your rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the license terms
applicable to any particular component.

2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their
components are owned by Red Hat and other licensors and are protected
under copyright law and under other laws as applicable. Title to the
Programs and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged
portion shall remain with Red Hat and other licensors, subject to the
applicable license. The “JBoss” trademark, “Red Hat” trademark, the
individual Program trademarks, and the “Shadowman” logo are registered
trademarks of Red Hat and its affiliates in the U.S. and other
countries. This EULA does not permit you to distribute the Programs
using Red Hat's trademarks, regardless of whether they have been
modified. You may make a commercial redistribution of the Programs only
if (a) permitted under a separate written agreement with Red Hat
authorizing such commercial redistribution or (b) you remove and
replaced all occurrences of Red Hat trademarks and logos. Modifications
to the software may corrupt the Programs. You should read the
information found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/
before distributing a copy of the Programs.

3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a
separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular
component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
Programs and the components are provided and licensed “as is” without
warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including the implied
warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a
particular purpose. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the
Programs and the components are provided will be free from defects in
materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from
the date of delivery to you. Neither Red Hat nor its affiliates warrant
that the functions contained in the Programs will meet your requirements
or that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free,
appear or perform precisely as described in the accompanying
documentation, or comply with regulatory requirements. This warranty
extends only to the party that purchases subscription services for the
Programs from Red Hat and/or its affiliates or a Red Hat authorized
distributor.

4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law, your exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return
any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of your
payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund
the money you paid for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law, under no circumstances will Red Hat, its affiliates, any
Red Hat authorized distributor, or the licensor of any component
provided to you under this EULA be liable to you for any incidental or
consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising
out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even
if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized distributor, and/or licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall
Red Hat's or its affiliates’ liability, an authorized distributor’s
liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to
you under this EULA exceed the amount that you paid to Red Hat for the
media under this EULA.

5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and
other countries, you represent and warrant that you: (a) understand that
the Programs and their components may be subject to export controls
under the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations
(“EAR”); (b) are not located in a prohibited destination country under
the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North
Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change as posted by the United States
government); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the Programs to
any prohibited destination, persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of
Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals
and Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries,
without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will
not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses
where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the
relevant government agency by regulation or specific license; (e)
understand and agree that if you are in the United States and export or
transfer the Programs to eligible end users, you will, to the extent
required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which include the
name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (f)
understand that countries including the United States may restrict the
import, use, or export of encryption products (which may include the
Programs and the components) and agree that you shall be solely
responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export
restrictions.

6. Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software
programs with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These
third party software programs are not required to run the Programs, are
provided as a convenience to you, and are subject to their own license
terms. The license terms either accompany the third party software
programs or can be viewed at
http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html. If you do not agree
to abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software
programs, then you may not install them. If you wish to install the
third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the
third party software programs to another party, then you must contact
the licensor of the applicable third party software programs.

7. General. If any provision of this EULA is held to be unenforceable,
the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.
Any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or relating to this EULA
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United
States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights
and obligations of the parties to this EULA shall not be governed by the
United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
