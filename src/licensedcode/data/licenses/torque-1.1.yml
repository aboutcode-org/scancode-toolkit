notes: |
    Per Fedora, when the licensing for TORQUE 2.4 expired, the TORQUE upstream
    drafted a new license with updated contact information. The intention was
    to have a lawyer retain the same functionality as the older licensing, but
    because part of it was misread or accidentally ignored, v1.0 of the TORQUE
    v2.5+ Software License contained commercial use restrictions which made it
    non-free. After this issue was raised on the TORQUE mailing lists, the
    TORQUE upstream revised the license to remove the commercial use
    restrictions in v1.1. The TORQUE v2.5+ Software License v1.1 is Free, but
    GPL incompatible because of the advertising clause. Also noteworthy is that
    this license references the fact that much of the TORQUE v2.5 code is
    derived from OpenPBS''s code, so the TORQUE v2.5+ software is properly dual
    licensed TORQUEv1.1 and OpenPBS. This also means that this license is not
    useful for other codebases without removing Note 1.
