I read some of Ian F. Darwin's BSD C implementation, to
try to determine how some of this was done since the specification
is a little vague.  I don't believe that this perl version could
be construed as an "altered version", but I did grab the tokens for
identifying the hard-coded file types in names.h and copied some of
the man page.
