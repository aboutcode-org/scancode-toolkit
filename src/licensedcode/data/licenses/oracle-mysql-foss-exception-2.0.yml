    MySQL FOSS License Exception
    We want free and open source software applications under certain licenses
    to be able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL Connector (specified GPL-licensed
    MySQL client libraries) despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses
    are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.
    Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions of the
    GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, which are identified and
    described in more detail in the FOSS License Exception at
    <http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>
    This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.
    OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
