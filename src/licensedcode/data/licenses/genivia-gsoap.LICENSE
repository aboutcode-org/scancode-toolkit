Licensing Options

There are three licensing options.

Standard Open Source Edition: The open source edition offers basic functionality
without the use of the wsdl2h tool (no WSDL/schemas to code generation), no
webserver, no UDDI support, and no sample applications to use as basis for your
projects. The limited edition is licensed under the gSOAP public license free of
charge for commercial use. The gSOAP public license requires a notice (Exhibit
B) in the project documentation and in the third-party license list of the
product.

Standard Commercial Edition: The standard edition of the gSOAP toolset for
commercial use. This edition is identical to the standard open source edition,
but allows the use of the wsdl2h and soapcpp2 tools for commercial code and
document generation. This licens does not have the limitations of the open-
source GPL and gSOAP public licenses. The standard commercial edition is
licensed with limited warranties.

Enterprise Edition: The enterprise edition of the gSOAP toolset provides the
gold standard toolset for your enterprise. The enterprise edition is best suited
for organizations that require high reliability, security, and extensive support
for WSDL, SOAP, XML, and WS-* protocols. Warranties, software maintenance and
support are included.

To determine the applicable license or to inquire about license and support cost
