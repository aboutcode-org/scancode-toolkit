    "Platform Services" means the Oculus Platform Framework and the Application Services.

3.1 Oculus Platform Services. Oculus makes certain Platform Services available to you to include and enable in your Developer Content. Developer Content that enables or includes any Platform Service must implement the Oculus Platform Framework with that Developer Content. Once your Developer Content has been authorized for use of the Platform Services, you are not required to update your Developer Content to include new Platform Services Oculus may make available as part of the Oculus Platform Framework.

3.2 Limited Authorization. You hereby grant Oculus the limited authorization reasonably necessary for Oculus's exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under this Section 3.

Oculus agrees to authenticate and make Developer Content available to any end user supplying a valid Key (unless the Developer Content has been removed or withdrawn).

3.5 Platform Services Requirements. You will not make any use of any API, software, code or other item or information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Services other than to enhance the functionality of your Developer Content. In particular, you must not (nor enable others to): (i) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others, or to promote or facilitate any prohibited or illegal activities; (ii) enable any functionality in your Developer Content that would generate excessive traffic over the Oculus network or servers that would negatively impact other users' experience, or otherwise interfere with or restrict the operation of the Platform Services, or Oculus's servers or networks providing the Platform Services; or (iii) remove, obscure, or alter any Oculus license terms, policies or terms of service or any links to or notices thereto.

Oculus may suspend operation of or remove any Developer Content that does not comply with the restrictions in this License.

You will not use the Oculus Avatar associated with the Oculus ID of any end user in your Developer Content without the express permission of that end user unless, (i) that end user is actively engaged with your Developer Content or (ii) that end user remains part of an active session of your Developer Content with whom other end users are interacting, whether or not that end user is then online.

The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority. You and Oculus agree the following may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction located within San Francisco, California and further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco, California in connection with (a) any entrance of an arbitrator's judgment or decision, (b) any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure, (c) Oculus’ exercise of any of its equitable rights or remedies or (d) any claims regarding the ownership, validity, enforceability and/or infringement of any intellectual property rights.
