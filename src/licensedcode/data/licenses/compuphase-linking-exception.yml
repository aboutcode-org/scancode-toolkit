    EXCEPTION TO THE APACHE 2.0 LICENSE
    As a special exception to the Apache License 2.0 (and referring to the
    definitions in Section 1 of this license), you may link, statically or
    dynamically, the "Work" to other modules to produce an executable file
    containing portions of the "Work", and distribute that executable file
    in "Object" form under the terms of your choice, without any of the
    additional requirements listed in Section 4 of the Apache License 2.0.
    This exception applies only to redistributions in "Object" form (not
    "Source" form) and only if no modifications have been made to the "Work".
