notes: |-
    This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual license COPYING dated from 2019-09-25  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby/ruby/2cd6800fd8437b1f862f3f5c44db877159271d17/COPYING
    notes from SPDX:
    Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last substantive variation being in 2002.
