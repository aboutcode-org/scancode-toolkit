notes: This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual license COPYING dated
    from 2010-09-15 Per SPDX.org, Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice
    of this license and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally,
    to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby License itself
    is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last substantive variation being
    in 2002.
