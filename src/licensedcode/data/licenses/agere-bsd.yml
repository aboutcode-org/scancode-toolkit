notes: commonly found in Linux The driver is coverred by the following copyright and software
    license. ... license text ... The following statement from Agere clarifies the status of
    the firmware. I would like to confirm that the two drivers; Linux LKM Wireless Driver Source
    Code, Version 7.18 and Linux LKM Wireless Driver Source Code, Version 7.22 comply with Open
    Source BSD License. Therefore the source code can be distributed in unmodified or modified
    form consistent with the terms of the license. The Linux driver architecture was based on
    two modules, the MSF (Module specific functions) and the HCF (Hardware Control Functions).
    Included in the HCF is run-time firmware (binary format) which is downloaded into the RAM
    of the Hermes 1/2/2.5 WMAC. This hex coded firmware is not based on any open source software
    and hence it is not subject to any Open Source License. The firmware was developed by Agere
    and runs on the DISC processor embedded within the Hermes 1/2/2.5 Wireless MAC devices.
    Hope this helps. Sincerely, Viren Pathare Intellectual Property Licensing Manager Agere
