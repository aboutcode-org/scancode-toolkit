Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this Agreement shall survive.

5.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against BEA or a Contributor (BEA or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Covered Code directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.0of this Agreement shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Covered Code against such Participant.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Covered Code, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.0 are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

5.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Covered Code directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.0 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

5.4. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
