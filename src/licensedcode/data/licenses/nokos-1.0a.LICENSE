3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1 Application of License.


The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License
or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include
a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

3.2 Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available
in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to
whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients.
You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3 Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the
name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
Software.

3.4  Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under
Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim
in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.

If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
this License.

3.5 Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one
or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for
the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer.

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the
Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
offer.

3.7 Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and
to related Covered Software.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.


6.1 New Versions.

Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2 Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Software created under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
survive.

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor
against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1
and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.

b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by
such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A
PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S.
$50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any
party dealing as a consumer.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All
rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.
Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of
Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any
part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled
by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The
arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language.
If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the
validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable
according to its terms.

11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
to constitute any admission of liability.
