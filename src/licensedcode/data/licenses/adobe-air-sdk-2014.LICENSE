5. DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVACY.
5.1 Development. You shall not create or distribute any software, including any Developer Application that interoperates with individual Runtime Components in a manner not documented by Adobe. You shall not create or distribute any software, including any Developer Application that is designed to interoperate with an un-installed instance of the Runtime Software. You shall not create or distribute any Developer Application that runs without installation. You are not permitted to install or use the Build Tools or other portions of the SDK to develop software prohibited by this agreement. Failure to comply with this Section 5.1 is a breach of this agreement that immediately terminates all rights granted to you herein.

5.2 Other Prohibitions. You will not use the SDK to create, develop or use any program, software or service that (a) contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information, (b) when used in the manner in which it is intended or marketed, violates any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or rights (including any laws, regulations or rights respecting intellectual property, computer spyware, privacy, export control, unfair competition, antidiscrimination or advertising), or (c) interferes with the operability of Adobe or third-party programs or software.

Development, use or distribution of a Developer Application that operates on non-PC devices and that decodes MP3 data not contained within a SWF, FLV or other file format that contains more than MP3 data may require one or more third-party license(s).

5.5 Privacy. You will comply with all data protection and privacy laws and rules applicable to the personal information of your end users. You will conspicuously post a privacy policy that tells users what personal data you are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer that data.
