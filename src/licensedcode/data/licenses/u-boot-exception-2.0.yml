    The U-Boot Exception:
    NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover the so-called "standalone"
    applications that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided
    by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered normal use
    of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    The header files "include/image.h" and "include/asm-*/u-boot.h" define
    interfaces to U-Boot. Including these (unmodified) header files in another
    file is considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the
    heading of "derived work".
    Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the U-Boot source
    code) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.
