Google Analytics Terms of Service

These Google Analytics Terms of Service (this "Agreement") are entered into by
Google Inc. ("Google") and the entity executing this Agreement ("You"). This
Agreement governs Your use of the standard Google Analytics (the "Service"). BY
CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING
THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT
AND ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF, AND BIND TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OWNER OF
THIS ACCOUNT. In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions.

"Account" refers to the billing account for the Service. All Profiles linked to
a single Property will have their Hits aggregated before determining the charge
for the Service for that Property.

"Confidential Information" includes any proprietary data and any other
information disclosed by one party to the other in writing and marked
"confidential" or disclosed orally and, within five business days, reduced to
writing and marked "confidential". However, Confidential Information will not
include any information that is or becomes known to the general public, which is
already in the receiving party's possession prior to disclosure by a party or
which is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of
Confidential Information.

"Customer Data" or “Google Analytics Data" means the data you collect, process
or store using the Service concerning the characteristics and activities of
Visitors.

"Documentation" means any accompanying documentation made available to You by
Google for use with the Processing Software, including any documentation
available online.

"GATC" means the Google Analytics Tracking Code, which is installed on a
Property for the purpose of collecting Customer Data, together with any fixes,
updates and upgrades provided to You.

"Hit" means the base unit that the Google Analytics system processes. A Hit may
be a call to the Google Analytics system by various libraries, including,
Javascript (e.g., analytics.js), Silverlight, Flash, and Mobile. A Hit may
currently be a page view, a transaction, item, or event, social interaction, or
user timing. Hits may also be delivered to the Google Analytics system without
using one of the various libraries by other Google Analytics-supported protocols
and mechanisms the Service makes available to You.

"Processing Software" means the Google Analytics server-side software and any
upgrades, which analyzes the Customer Data and generates the Reports.

"Profile" means the collection of settings that together determine the
information to be included in, or excluded from, a particular Report. For
example, a Profile could be established to view a small portion of a web site as
a unique Report. There can be multiple Profiles established under a single
Property.

"Property" means any web page, app, or other property under Your control that
sends data to Google Analytics. Each Property includes a default Profile that
measures all pages within the Property.

"Privacy Policy" means the privacy policy on a Property.

"Report" means the resulting analysis shown at www.google.com/analytics for a
Profile.

"Servers" means the servers controlled by Google (or its wholly owned
subsidiaries) on which the Processing Software and Customer Data are stored.

"Software" means the GATC and the Processing Software.

"Third Party" means any third party (i) to which You provide access to Your
Account or (i) for which You use the Service to collect information on the third
party's behalf.

"Visitors" means visitors to Your Properties.

The words "include" and "including" mean "including but not limited to."

2. Fees and Service.

Subject to Section 15, the Service is provided without charge to You for up to
10 million Hits per month per account. Google may change its fees and payment
policies for the Service from time to time including the addition of costs for
geographic data, the importing of cost data from search engines, or other fees
charged to Google or its wholly-owned subsidiaries by third party vendors for
the inclusion of data in the Service reports. The changes to the fees or payment
policies are effective upon Your acceptance of those changes which will be
posted at www.google.com/analytics. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted
in U.S. Dollars. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable
upon termination of this Agreement and any collection expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by Google will be included in the amount owed, and may
be charged to the credit card or other billing mechanism associated with Your
AdWords account.

3. Member Account, Password, and Security.

To register for the Service, You must complete the registration process by
providing Google with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by
the registration form, including Your e-mail address (username) and password.
You will protect Your passwords and take full responsibility for Your own, and
third party, use of Your accounts. You are solely responsible for any and all
activities that occur under Your Account. You will notify Google immediately
upon learning of any unauthorized use of Your Account or any other breach of
security. Google's (or its wholly-owned subsidiaries') support staff may, from
time to time, log in to the Service under Your customer password in order to

and access to the Documentation, Software, Service and Reports.

5. Confidentiality.

Neither party will use or disclose the other party's Confidential Information
without the other's prior written consent except for the purpose of performing

practicable prior to disclosing the Confidential Information.

terms of its privacy policy (located at www.google.com/privacy.html),
information collected in Your use of the Service. Google will not share Your
Customer Data or any Third Party's Customer Data with any third parties unless
Google (i) has Your consent for any Customer Data or any Third Party's consent
for the Third Party's Customer Data; (ii) concludes that it is required by law
or has a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of Customer
Data is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of
Google, its users or the public; or (iii) provides Customer Data in certain
limited circumstances to third parties to carry out tasks on Google's behalf
(e.g., billing or data storage) with strict restrictions that prevent the data
from being used or shared except as directed by Google. When this is done, it is
subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process Customer Data only on
Google's instructions and in compliance with this Agreement and appropriate
confidentiality and security measures.

7. Privacy.

You will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Service to track,
collect or upload any data that personally identifies an individual (such as a

reasonably linked to such information by Google. You will have and abide by an
appropriate Privacy Policy and will comply with all applicable laws, policies,
and regulations relating to the collection of information from Visitors. You
must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your
use of cookies that are used to collect data. You must disclose the use of
Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. This can be done by
displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data when you use our
partners' sites or apps”, (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/,
or any other URL Google may provide from time to time). You will use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a Visitor is provided with clear
and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing
of cookies or other information on the Visitor’s device where such activity
occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and
obtaining such consent is required by law.

all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against Google
or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, and all
related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses

subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between
the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for

enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the
parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the
state of California without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the

a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This
Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The following sections of this
Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1, 4, 5, 6 (except the last two
