    notes from SPDX:
    Per Fedora: MPL 1.1 derived license with a few distinct changes: They typoed the version number in Exhibit A (it says it is 1.0, which confused me at first, when I came across code using that attribution in its headers but could not find a 1.0 license text). Section 8.2 (b) has been removed entirely. The following text block has been removed from Section 11: "With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses." The following text block has been removed from Exhibit A: "Alternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the terms of the _____ license (the "[___] License"), in which case the provisions of [______] License are applicable instead of those above. If you wish to allow use of your version of this file only under the terms of the [____] License and not to allow others to use your version of this file under the MPL, indicate your decision by deleting the provisions above and replace them with the notice and other provisions required by the [___] License. If you do not delete the provisions above,a recipient may use your version of this file under either the MPL or the [___] License.""
