notes: the home page contains these comments This is a slightly modified version of the three
    clause BSD license. It adds a clause to explicitly state the patent protection that this
    license provides (which is none). The ADI BSD License is similar to the Clear BSD License,
    which the Free Software Foundation indicates is compatible with both GPLv2 and GPLv3. If
    you have any questions about license compatibility - consult your nearest lawyer. Before
    incorporating code licensed under the ADI BSD license into projects which you are going
    to ship in a end product, you must ensure that you have the patent rights to do.
