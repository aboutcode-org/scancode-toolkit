Exception for Development Version 1.04, January 18, 2013

Exception Intent

We want people who build extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks, language packs and themes for Sencha frameworks and libraries to be able to publicly distribute them under less restrictive license terms, even though version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the “GPL”) may require them to be licensed under the GPL.

This Exception does not grant usage or distribution of any Sencha development library under a license other than the GPL and cannot be applied to end-user applications. For applications, please refer to the Open Source License Exception for Applications.
Terms and Conditions
Definitions

    Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
    “Library” means Ext JS, Sencha Touch or Sencha GXT, for which this exception is applicable.
    “Code” means source code for the Library or Extension.
    “Images” means images distributed with Code.
    “Modification” means a visual change or enhancement made to a Library Component (“Component”) by means of modifying the standard functionality or visual appearance of the Component.


*“Extension” means the combination of Code and Images to form a Modification or a completely new and original Component.

Additional Grants

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

You are free to distribute an Extension licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 5, as long as:

    Your Extension does not contain any Code or modified Code from the Library.
    You do not distribute the Library, as a whole or in part, with your Extension. Optionally, you should include instructions for developers using your Extension explaining how to obtain the Library.
    You include PROMINENT notice in EVERY location you display the license information for your Extension that it uses the Library, that the Library is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3 and you must include a link to http://www.sencha.com/license.
    Your Extension is distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and is accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the Extension
    Your Extension can reasonably be considered to be adding to or modifying standard functionality of the Library for software development purposes and does not constitute an independent and separate application in itself.

Applicability

This exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later, Sencha Touch 1.0 or later and Sencha GXT version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a conspicuous notice with the Derivative Work and conspicuously posted online near any download location, saying that Derivative Works built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception and that the included Library is subject to the terms of the GPL v3.

This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any license other than the GPL v3.
Termination

If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.
