CCPN temporary license

We have not yet had time to create a proper CCPN license for those
parts of the software which are not LGPL.  So for now we have the
following temporary license.

The programs which fall under this license contain reserved and/or
proprietary information belonging to the author and/or organisation
holding the copyright.  They may not be used, distributed, modified,
transmitted, stored, or in any way accessed, except by members or
employees of the CCPN, and by these people only until 31 December 2006
and in accordance with the guidelines of the CCPN.
