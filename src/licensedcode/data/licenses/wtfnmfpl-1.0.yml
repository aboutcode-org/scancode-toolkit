notes: The Do What The Fuck You Want To But It's Not My Fault Public License (WTFNMFPL or WTFNMFPLv1)
    is a variation on the Do What The Fuck You Want Public License (WTFPL) by Sam Hocevar. Essentially
    it is the same as the WTFPL, except with an additional clause to indemnify the author, creator,
    developer or distributor against anything a third party might do or encounter with or as
    a result of whatever's being licensed with it. This license was first published at Organised
    Adversary in October, 2013. The license is free to use by anyone as per the terms of itself.
