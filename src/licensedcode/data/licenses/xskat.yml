notes: Per Fedora, this license is Free only when clause 2.b is used. It is always GPL-incompatible.
    Packagers using code under this license in Fedora should note that while the RPM changelog
    is sufficient to meet one requirement of clause 2.b (to "clearly state who last changed
    the program"), the Release field in the RPM is not enough to meet the other requirement
    of clause 2.b. Packagers can meet the other requirement by simply adding a .0 to the end
    of the upstream version in the RPM package. You need to do this, and not simply use the
    regular NVR to fulfill 2.b, because the license explicitly specifies the versioning schema
    x.y.z, which is different from how RPM displays it (x.y-z). Just add a dummy .0 to the end
    of the version then increment the Release field like any other package.
