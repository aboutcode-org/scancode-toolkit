notes: Per Fedora, there is a certain irony in a Frenchman writing a license that isn't wholly
    applicable in France, due to Moral Rights. But I digress. This license is basically the
    same as the WTFPL (with slightly less profanity). It is Free and GPL-Compatible. A copy
    of the license text was taken from http://imapsync.lamiral.info/COPYING on 2012-07-09.
