    notes from SPDX:
    Per Fedora: "There is a certain irony in a Frenchman writing a license that isn't wholly applicable in France, due to Moral Rights. But I digress. This license is basically the same as the WTFPL (with slightly less profanity). It is Free and GPL-Compatible. A copy of the license text was taken from http://imapsync.lamiral.info/COPYING on 2012-07-09."
