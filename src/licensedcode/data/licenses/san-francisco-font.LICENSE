under this License will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple (a) if
you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License, (b) if you are no longer a registered Apple Developer,
or (c) if Apple releases a version of the Apple Font which is incompatible with this version of the Apple
Font. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Apple Font and destroy all

AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.

B. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLE FONT IS PROVIDED
“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND
APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “APPLE” FOR THE PURPOSES
OF SECTIONS 5 AND 6) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO

6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY

ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, OR SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE
FONT, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be
required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
