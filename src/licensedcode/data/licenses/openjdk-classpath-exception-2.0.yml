    "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
    Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to
    the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but
    only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's
    header the words
    "Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
    exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this
    code."
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.
    OPENJDK ASSEMBLY EXCEPTION
    The OpenJDK source code made available openjdk.dev.java.net ("OpenJDK
    Code") is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
    <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html> version 2 only ("GPL2"), with the
    following clarification and special exception.
    Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with other code is
    making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
    conditions of GPL2 cover the whole combination.
    As a special exception, Sun gives you permission to link this OpenJDK Code
    with certain code licensed by Sun as indicated at
    http://openjdk.java.net/legal/exception-modules-2007-05-08.html
    ("Designated Exception Modules") to produce an executable, regardless of
    the license terms of the Designated Exception Modules, and to copy and
    distribute the resulting executable under GPL2, provided that the
    Designated Exception Modules continue to be governed by the licenses under
    which they were offered by Sun.
    As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Sun's GPL2 OpenJDK Code to
    build an executable that includes those portions of necessary code that Sun
    could not provide under GPL2 (or that Sun has provided under GPL2 with the
    Classpath exception). If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code, that new
    GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception Modules if the
    new code is made subject to this exception by its copyright holder.
