    notes from SPDX:
    Per Fedora: The Trusster Open Source License (TOSL) is a derivation of the Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where the Sleepycat License says: The source code must either be included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable conditions. TOSL is somewhat more specific: The source code must either be included in the distribution or be available in a timely fashion for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions. While the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license, TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the "no more restrictive" language.
