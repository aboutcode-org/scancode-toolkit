AGENTX++ LICENSE AGREEMENT 
==========================

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is  made effective as of the date  the
product is  installed by  and between  (i) Frank  Fock, the  author of  AgentX++
("LICENSOR") and the party executing this Agreement as Licensee ("LICENSEE").


1. DEFINITIONS.

1.1 The term  "Software Product" means  Frank Fock's AgentX++  computer software
(including Source  Code, derived  Object Code,  and derived  Executable Code  as
defined in Section 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5) and documentation thereof, as specified in
Exhibit A,  that is  provided by  LICENSOR to  LICENSEE hereunder, including bug
fixes and updates  thereto provided by  LICENSOR to LICENSEE  in connection with
this Agreement. The term "derived" in the above context refers to the process of
creating machine executable  code from  the original Source Code only.  It  does
not refer  to amendment or alteration  of the original  Source Code by  LICENSOR
or any  third party.

1.2  The  term "Intellectual  Property  Rights" means  patent  rights, copyright
rights, trade secret rights, and any other intellectual property rights.

1.3 The  term "Executable  Code" is  a fully  compiled and  linked program  that
contains any code derived from the Software Product. It can no longer be altered
or combined with any  other code. Executable code  is ready to be  executed by a
computer and  is essentially  a complete  software image  for use  in a specific
product. 

1.4 The term "Object Code" is any compiled version of the Software Product  that
can be linked and therefore combined with other code to create Executable  Code.
Examples  of  Object  Code  are  libraries  and  software  development  kits, in
particular SNMP agent development kits. 

1.5 The term "Source Code" is  the human readable form of the  Software Product,
as specified in Exhibit A.

1.6  Documentation  means  the  documentation  regarding  the  Licensed Software
provided by LICENSOR to LICENSEE hereunder.

1.7 The term "Site"  is a specific address  belonging to a single  business unit
operating at that address.


2. GRANT OF LICENSE.

2.1 Source  Code Site  License.  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions of  this
Agreement, and upon payment by LICENSEE to LICENSOR of the one-time license  fee
set  forth in  Addendum A,  LICENSOR grants  LICENSEE a  perpetual (subject   to
termination rights  in Section  6), non-exclusive,  non-transferable license  to
reproduce, use,   modify,  or   have  modified   by a   third  party  contractor
(modifications  in  accordance to  Section  2.6) subject   to  a confidentiality
agreement  no   less restrictive  than   this Agreement,  the   Source Code  for
internal  use  only, for   the sole  purpose  of  developing AgentX-enabled SNMP
agents at  the Site  (hereafter "Licensed  Site") specified  by LICENSEE  during
license purchase. Additionally,  Customer’s contractors and  employees reporting
directly and only to a manager at the Licensed Site, such as telecommuters,  may
use the Software Product at  remote locations. Off-site employees re-porting  in
any way to a manager at their location are not covered under this Site License.  

2.2 Except as  specified in 2.1,  neither the Software  Product Source Code  nor
Object Code derived  from the Software  Product may be  redistributed or resold.
Executable Code programs derived from the Software Product may be  redistributed
and  resold  without limitation  and   without royalty,  provided  that LICENSEE
added  significant functionality  to those  derived Excecutable  Code programs.
Functionality in this context refers to the program's behavior, not appearance.

2.3  No Sublicense  Right.  LICENSEE  has no  right to  transfer, or  sublicense
the Licensed Software  to  any third   party, except  as  specified in 2.2   and
