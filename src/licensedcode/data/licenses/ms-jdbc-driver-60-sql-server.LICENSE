3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you 
some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law 
gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly 
permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in 
the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

* work around any technical limitations in the software;

4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and 
regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and 
regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end 
users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

5. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is" we may not provide support 
services for it.

6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-
based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software 
and support services.

7. APPLICABLE LAW.

a. United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law 
governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, 
regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all 
other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition 
laws, and in tort.

b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of 
that country apply.

8. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights 
under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from 
whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws 
of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS". YOU 
BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS 
WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE 
ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS 
AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER 
YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT.

10. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN 
RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP 
TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

* anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet 
sites, or third party programs, and
* claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, 
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the 
damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may 
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
