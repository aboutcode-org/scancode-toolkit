    As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or
    all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of
    your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the
    skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton. Alternatively,
    if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your
    option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and
    the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General
    Public License without this special exception.
    This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version
    2.2 of Bison.
