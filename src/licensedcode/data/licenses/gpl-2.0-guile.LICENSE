As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives permission

The exception is that, if you link the GUILE library with other files to
produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting
executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License. Your use of
that executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the GUILE
library code into it.

This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

This exception applies only to the code released by the Free Software
Foundation under the name GUILE. If you copy code from other Free
Software Foundation releases into a copy of GUILE, as the General Public
License permits, the exception does not apply to the code that you add
in this way. To avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such
modified files, you must delete this exception notice from them.

If you write modifications of your own for GUILE, it is your choice
whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications. If you
do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
