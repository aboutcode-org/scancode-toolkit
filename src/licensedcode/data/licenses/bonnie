Moral Obligation

It is Tim Bray's opinion that anyone who makes use of Bonnie thus incurs a moral obligation, in the interest of making Bonnie and the results of using Bonnie more widely available, to do the following:

   1. If possible, transmit to Tim Bray any compiled binary versions of Bonnie for which an equivalent does not exist on the Web site
   2. If possible, to transmit to Tim Bray the results of Bonnie runs, along with enough information about the run to make the numbers useful to others.

Tim Bray warrants that:

   1. On request, he will take all reasonable measures to protect the privacy of anyone who wishes to submit binaries or results
   2. He will never take any positive action, aside from this statement, to compel anyone to act according to this perception of their moral obligations.
