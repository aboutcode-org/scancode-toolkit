3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

3.1. Application of License

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
Section 2.2 ("Contributor Grant"). The Documentation may be distributed
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released in accordance with Section 5.0 ("Versions of the License"), and
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Documentation You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms that
alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional
document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5
("Required Notices").

3.2. Availability of Documentation.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available publicly in Editable Form under the terms of this License
via a fixed medium or an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism.

3.3. Description of Modifications.

All Documentation to which You contribute must identify the changes You
made to create that Documentation and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
or indirectly, from Original Documentation provided by the Initial
Writer and include the name of the Initial Writer in the Documentation
or via an electronic link that describes the origin or ownership of the
Documentation. The foregoing change documentation may be created by
using an electronic program that automatically tracks changes to the
Documentation, and such changes must be available publicly for at least
five years following release of the changed Documentation.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

Contributor represents that Contributor believes that Contributor's
Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor
has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in the Appendix in each file of the
Documentation. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
Documentation file due to its structure, then You must include such
notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a reader would
be likely to look for such a notice, for example, via a hyperlink in
each file of the Documentation that takes the reader to a page that
describes the origin and ownership of the Documentation. If You created
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to
the notice described in the Appendix.

a hyperlink in each file of the Documentation) where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Documentation. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Writer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Writer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Writer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Documentation with other

Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Documentation.

version. You may also choose to use such Documentation under the terms
of any subsequent version of the License published by
 [Insert name of the foundation, company, Initial
