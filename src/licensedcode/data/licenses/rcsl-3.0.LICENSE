(RCSL R&D)
Version 3.0 (Rev. Date:  May 29, 2007)
 
RECITALS
 
RealNetworks, Inc. (“RN”) has developed Specifications, Source Code implementations and Executables of the Helix DNA Code, and an associated TCK; and
 
RN desires to license the Helix DNA Code to a large community to facilitate research, innovation and product development while maintaining compatibility of such products with the Helix DNA Code as delivered by RN;
 
Therefore, RN makes available the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, and the TCK available for Research and Development Use only under the following terms: 
 
LICENSE
 
1.  Introduction. 
 
The RealNetworks Community Source License – Research and Development Use (“RCSL R&D” or “License”) is a license to use the Source Code of certain portions of the Helix DNA Code, Specifications, and the TCK for research and development use only.   You (“Licensee,” as more specifically defined below) accept the terms of this License by downloading or using the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, or the TCK, unless Licensee and RN have signed a license agreement that expressly supersedes this RCSL R&D. 
 
This License does not include a license to access or modify the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires the right to receive access to the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code for the purposes of porting and optimization, Licensee and RN may elect to execute a Real Format Source Code Porting and Optimization Agreement.
 
This License does not include a license to make Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires a license for Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code, Licensee and RN may desire to execute the RealNetworks Community Source License - Commercial Use (“RCSL Commercial”) for the version of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code of which Licensee would like to make Commercial Use.  Once executed by Licensee and RN, the RCSL Commercial would supersede the terms of this License.
 
Capitalized terms used in this License are defined in the Glossary attached to the end of this License.

2.4 Subcontracting. 
 
                        Licensee may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Helix Licensees for the sole purpose of furnishing development services to Licensee in connection with Licensee’s rights granted in this License, provided that Licensee does not enter a separate agreement with such Licensee that contains provisions inconsistent with the ownership and licensing requirements set forth in this License. 
 
3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.
 
3.1 Research Use License. 
 
As a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, Licensee must comply with the following:
 
(a) Licensee’s Contributions.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which Licensee creates are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.  Licensee is encouraged to license all of Licensee’s other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but is not required to do so.  Licensee must notify RN of any errors in the Specifications.
 
(b) Source Code Availability.  Licensee must provide all of Licensee’s Error Corrections to RN as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than when Licensee shares such Error Corrections with any other Helix Licensee.  RN may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications at the Helix Community Website.  
 
(c) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications that Licensee creates or contributes to must include a file documenting the additions and changes Licensee made and the date of such additions and changes.  Licensee must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header of any Error Correction or Shared Modification.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then Licensee must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.
 
(d) Redistribution.
 
(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Helix Licensee (except for students as provided below).  Licensee may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Helix Licensee.  Licensee may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Helix Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.
 
(ii) Executable.  Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee’s choice, but that limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.
 
(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming.  In connection with Research Use by Licensee only, Licensee may use RN's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files that Licensee modifies.  RN grants to Licensee a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes. 
 
(e) Extensions. 
 
(i) Licensee may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions.  Licensee may include the compiled Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Licensee’s use of the Covered Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.  
 
(ii) Open.  Licensee must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights Licensee may have covering any Interface(s) of Licensee’s Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such Interface(s) by RN or any Helix Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent Licensee from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right Licensee has that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Licensee’s Extension.
 
(iii) Interface Modifications and Naming.  Licensee may not modify or add to the GUID space   "xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59" or any other GUID space designated by RN.  Licensee may not modify any Interface prefix provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix designated by RN. 
 
(f) Any Specifications provided to Licensee by RN are confidential and proprietary information of RN.  Licensee must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications and may not disclose them to any third party without RN’s prior written consent.  Licensee may only use the Specifications under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing the terms of this License with respect to Community Code.  Licensee may not use, copy or distribute any such Specifications except as provided in writing by RN.
 
No Commercial Use. 
 
Licensee may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless Licensee and RN have executed a copy of the RCSL - Commercial available at the Helix Community Website, or another license agreement expressly granting commercial use rights.  
 
4.  Versions of the License.
 
4.1 License Versions.
 
RN may publish revised versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  No one other than RN has the right to promulgate versions of this License.
 
4.2 Effect of New License Versions.
 
(a) Once a particular version of Covered Code has been provided under a version of this License, Licensee may always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.  Licensee may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License, but not under a prior version of the License.  (For example, if a version of Covered Code has been provided under RCSL R&D 2.1, Licensee may not use such Covered Code under RCSL R&D 2.0.) 
 
(b) Version 3.0 of this License (and all subsequent versions) supercedes versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0 of RCSL R&D plus Attachments A-C.
 
4.3 Multiple-Licensed Code.
