3.   INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

a.   Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see software documentation and the privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=205205. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

i.    Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft or a third party service provider uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

·      Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). This software uses CEIP. CEIP automatically sends Microsoft information about your hardware and how you use this software. We do not use this information to identify or contact you. To learn more about CEIP, see http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/en-us/privacypolicy.mspx.

4.   THIRD PARTY PACKAGE MANAGER. This software includes a package manager feature, which enables you to obtain other software packages from other sources. Those packages are offered and distributed in some cases by third parties or in some cases by Microsoft, but each such package is under its own license terms. Microsoft is not developing, distributing or licensing any of the third-party packages to you, but instead, as a convenience, is providing you with this package manager feature in order to access any packages for your own use. By using this package manager feature, you acknowledge and agree that you may be accessing and using the third-party packages as distributed by such third parties and under the separate license terms applicable to each package, including any terms applicable to software dependencies that may be included in the package. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to locate, understand and comply with all applicable license terms for each package and its dependencies, for example, by following the package source (feed) URL or by reviewing the packages for embedded notices or license terms. The package manager feature may have been pre-set to a feed that is hosted by a third party service provider, located at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206669. The packages listed on this feed may include packages submitted by third parties. Microsoft makes no representations, warranties or guarantees as to the feed URL, any feeds from such URL, the information contained therein, or any packages referenced in or accessed by you through such feeds. Microsoft grants you no license rights rights for third-party software that is obtained using this feature or from the feed. You may change the feed URL that the package manager feature initially points to at any time at your discretion.

14. APPLICABLE LAW.

a.   United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

15. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.

17. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.

This limitation applies to

·      anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

·      claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
