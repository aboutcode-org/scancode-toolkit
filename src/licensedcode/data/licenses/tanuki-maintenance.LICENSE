6. Standard level Maintenance and Support

6.1 Scope of Services
TSI will provide the following services to all Licensees:
- Answers to Installation and Authorization Questions
- Product Use Guidance
- Problem Diagnosis
- Software Program Configuration Help
- Software Program Updates
- New Media and documentation
- New Versions of the Software Program

These services exclude explicitly:
- Third-Party Products
- Hardware Platform Related Support
- Operating System Related Support
- Integration Advice or Any Other Consulting
- Training.  TSI maintains training and consulting departments that
can assist, on a fee-for-service basis, with some or all of the
services explicitly excluded as above.

6.2 Limitation
TSI supports the Software Program as described in the then-current
price book for which an annual TSIMS fee is paid. However, TSI will
fix errors in the current version and the immediately preceding
version of the Software Program. The Licensee will provide TSI with
all the necessary information on the application, the platform, and
the infrastructure at the supported Site. If any of such information
is confidential, the Licensee should notify TSI in accordance with the
confidentiality provision of the License Agreement.

6.3 Levels of Support
1st Level (or First Line Support) Support includes filing the problem
as an issue in TSI's database, querying the TSI database for similar
problems, bugs, and resolutions on the topic and communicating a
resolution or plan for a resolution back to the Licensee.

2nd Level Support includes further research on the issue and includes,
but is not limited to: recreating the problem in house, receiving and
working with pieces of Licensee's code that illustrate the behavior;
debugging Licensee's code and working to resolve the issue. 2nd Level
Support issues are typically assigned to a TSI Product Specialist.

3rd Level Support includes but is not limited to the assistance of
Product Support Specialists and Engineering Level Developers to assist
in debugging code, providing hints to solve the problem, working with
TSI product code to determine root causes.

When the Licensee acquires TSI products through a TSI Partner, it is
expected that the main support channel will be established through
that Partner. In that case, 1st level support will be handled by that
Partner, and TSI will communicate solely with the Partner on
Licensee's issues.

6.4 Priority of an Issue
The Licensee and TSI customer support staff shall jointly set issue
priority levels.

SEVERITY LEVEL 0 - CRISIS - An emergency deployment or production
environment situation where the Software Program is inoperable or
fails catastrophically and there is no workaround.

SEVERITY LEVEL 1 - HIGH - A detrimental situation where one of the
following conditions occurs:
1.) performance of the Software Program degrades substantially under
reasonable loads causing a severe impact on use; or 2.) one or more
primary functions or commands of the Software Program is inoperable.

SEVERITY LEVEL 2 - MEDIUM - Occurs when use of the Software Program is
noticeably affected but reasonably correctable by a workaround,
documentation change, or patch which may be completely resolved and
integrated into a future release.

SEVERITY LEVEL 3 - LOW - An inconvenient situation where the Software
Program is usable but does not provide a function in the most
convenient manner and the Licensee suffers little or no significant
impact.

6.5 Licensee Assistance and Responsibility in Problem Resolution
When filing an issue, Licensee shall make the following information
available to TSI:
- Maintenance Support Agreement Number
- Version (including revision level) of the TSI Software Program
  involved and any supporting product of software involved
- Platform (Including Operating System Revision Level) of the
  Operating Environment
- Error or other warning or advisory messages which you have been
  receiving
- A reproducible test case where applicable
- Any trace, log, and/or console files
- Configuration files
- Severity Level of problem
- Priority Business or other justification for Severity Level 0
  priority issues
- Licensee responsibility with regard to assisting in resolving the
  Licensee issue includes providing a Licensee on-site technical
  contact, whose availability and response should mirror the response
  level requested of TSI, to provide resource and operational
  assistance.

6.6 Response/Resolution Time
Within the business hours of the Customer Support Engineer responsible
for the issue:
Response Time: For the most prompt service, relevant technical detail
and quickest response time, (generally less than 1 day) issues should
be reported via email at wrapper-support@tanukisoftware.com. Response
to issues reported to Customer Support through fax, or telephone may
have longer response times.

Initial Analysis/Resolution Time:

Crisis Handled on a Case by Case Basis, but initial response will be
within 1 Business Day

High Within 5 Business Days

Medium Within 10 Business Days

Low Subject to Development and Customer Support Priority

Resolution means that Customer Support will use its reasonable efforts
to resolve Licensee issues as prioritized above. Resolution may
include: specification of a workaround; identification of a bug; or
the recognition that additional analysis work needs to be done, on the
part of Customer Support and the Licensee, which will extend beyond
the initial resolution time.
In all cases, resolution of issues by Customer Support will require
the Licensee to assist in the following: documentation and
reproduction of the issue; provision of a Licensee contact person with
whom TSI Customer Support can maintain contact to arrange for
analysis, testing, systems, and other resources and other tasks in
support of resolution of the Licensee's problem and to whom status
reports and requests for resources can be addressed.
Ongoing communication shall be maintained regarding Licensee issue
status and progress towards resolution between TSI Customer Support
and the Licensee's issue contact.

6.7 Notification
The Licensee will, by default, be notified by e-mail of all relevant
updates on the issue since appropriate levels of technical detail are
often best captured and presented via written e-mail.
TSI's Support staff can also maintain telephone contact with the
Licensee, if requested.

6.8 Distribution of Updates
Shipment of Updates and New Versions will be made on a request-only
basis. Requests can be made through an e-mail message.

6.9 Licensee Issues Are Typically Handled by Customer Support
Engineers
This is the primary and usual scenario. Contact is maintained between
the Licensee and the TSI Customer Support Engineer ("CSE") responsible
for the issue. The e-mail address to be used is:
