The term "Software" includes all elements of the Software such as data files, images appearing in the Software and screen displays.  You are not receiving any ownership or proprietary right, title or interest in or to the Software or the copyright, trademarks, or other rights related thereto.

You agree that the Software will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) by you or any one at your direction and that you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize, in any other manner, the Software in violation of any applicable law.  The Software may not be exported or reexported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to anyone or into any country who/which are prohibited, by applicable law, from receiving such property.

     2.  Additional Levels.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right to create additional levels (the "Levels") which are operable with the Software.  You may include within the Levels certain textures and other images (the "ID Images") from the Software.  You agree that the Levels will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) by you or anyone at your direction and that you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize, in any other manner, the Levels in violation of any applicable law.  The Levels may not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to anyone or into any country who/which are prohibited by applicable law, from receiving such property.
You shall not rent, sell, lease, lend, offer on a pay-per-play basis or otherwise commercially exploit or commercially distribute the Levels.  You are only permitted to distribute for free, without any cost or charge, the Levels to other endusers.  As noted below, in the event you commercially distribute or commercial exploit the Levels or commit any other breach of this Agreement, your licenses, as granted in this Agreement, shall automatically terminate, without notice. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ID and Activision and ID's and Activision's respective officers, employees, directors, agents, licensees (excluding you), sublicensees (excluding you), successors and assigns from and against all losses, lawsuits, damages, causes of action and claims relating to and/or arising from the Levels and/or the distribution or other use of the Levels.

You must treat the Software, the Printed Materials and the ID Images like any other copyrighted material, as required by 17 U.S.C., ยง101 et seq. and other applicable law.  You agree to use your best efforts to see that any user of the Software licensed hereunder, the Printed Materials or the Levels complies with this Agreement.  You agree that you are receiving a copy of the Software, including the ID Images, and the Printed Material by license only and not by sale and that the "first sale" doctrine of 17 U.S.C. ยง109 does not apply to your receipt or use of the Software, the Printed Materials or your inclusion of any ID Images in the Levels.  This section 5. shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

     6.  No ID Warranties.  ID DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, THE PRINTED MATERIALS AND THE ID IMAGES.  ID DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS SUCH AS PRESENTATIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES BY ID AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON.  This section 6.  shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

     7.  Limited Activision Warranty.  Activision warrants to the original consumer purchaser of the Software that the recording medium on which the Software is recorded will be free from defects in material and workmanship for 90 days from the date of purchase.  If the recording medium is found defective within 90 days of original purchase, Activision agrees to replace, free of charge, any product discovered to be defective within such period upon its receipt of the product, postage paid, with proof of the date of purchase, as long as the Software is still being manufactured by Activision.  In the event that the Software is no longer available, Activision retains the right to substitute a similar program of equal or greater value.  This warranty is limited to the recording medium containing the Software as originally provided by Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect.
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT, AND NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND SHALL BE BINDING ON OR OBLIGATE ACTIVISION.

When returning the Software for warranty replacement, the original product disks must be sent only in a protective packaging and include: (1) a photocopy of your dated sales receipt; (2) your name and return address typed or clearly printed; (3) a brief note describing the defect, the problem(s) you are encountered and the system on which you are running the Software; (4) if you are returning the Software after the 90-day warranty period, but within one year after the date of purchase, please include check or money order for $10 U.S. (A$17 for Australia, or ยฃ10.00 for Europe) currency per CD or floppy disk replacement.

IN ANY CASE, NEITHER ID, ACTIVISION, NOR ANY OF ID'S OR ACTIVISION'S RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, LICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUBLICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF  PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING FROM BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT PRODUCT  LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF ID, ACTIVISION OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENT(S) HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE, OR LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

     10.  General Provisions.  Neither this Agreement nor any part or portion hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed by you.  ID and Activision each may assign its respective rights under this Agreement in the assigning party's sole discretion.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby.  If any provision is determined to be unenforceable, you agree to a modification of such provision to provide for enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Failure of ID or Activision to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.  If you fail to comply with or breach any term or condition of this Agreement, YOUR LICENSES AND THIS AGREEMENT ARE AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED, WITHOUT NOTICE.  In the event this Agreement is terminated, you shall have no right to use the Software, the Printed Materials or the Levels, in any manner, and you shall immediately destroy all copies of the Software, the Printed Materials and the Levels in your possession, custody or control.

YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR WRITTEN SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ID, ACTIVISION AND YOU, IF ANY, THIS AGREEMENT IS A COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO.
