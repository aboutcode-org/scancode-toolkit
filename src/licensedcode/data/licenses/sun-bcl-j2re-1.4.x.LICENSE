paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing

contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's
rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set

and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
