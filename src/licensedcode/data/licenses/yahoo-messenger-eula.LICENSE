DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF YAHOO! MESSENGER AND OTHER YAHOO! AUTHORIZED IM CLIENTS

Not all features may be available if the user that you are communicating with is using a different version of Yahoo Messenger, or is using an IM software client offered by an authorized non-Yahoo company.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

Yahoo Messenger allows you to see when your friends are online, send and receive instant messages, make pc-to-pc and pc-to-phone calls, listen to music, play games, and receive alerts and other material and information via the World Wide Web.

Yahoo Toolbar allows users to quickly search the Web from anywhere online, save and re-find pages, protect your PC from spyware with Anti-Spy, access your favorite sites and enjoy music with Yahoo Music Engine controls.

Yahoo Browser Services gives you enhancements for Internet Explorer grouped neatly under Yahoo Services button and menu option. These services include Sign-In, which can store multiple Yahoo IDs for quick switching; Yahoo Messenger Explorer Bar, which allows you to see your friends list and send links to friends within Internet Explorer; and Yahoo Shortcuts, which allows you to set up address bar keywords to go to your favorite web sites.

From time to time, Yahoo may automatically download the latest version and notify you when itâ€™s ready to install. Visit the Privacy Module to find out more about Auto Updater. If you wish to update your Yahoo Messenger, you must agree to the then current Yahoo Messenger Terms of Service in order for the update to be installed on your computer.

HOW TO UNINSTALL: To uninstall, go to your operating system Control Panel, select Add/Remove Programs, and select Yahoo Messenger or other Yahoo application that you wish to uninstall. Click the Change/Remove button. Leave the selection on Automatic and click Next. Then click Finish and you are done! You may have to reboot to remove some components.

Yahoo Messenger, including any web-based versions, will allow you and the people with whom you communicate to save your conversations in your Yahoo accounts located on Yahoo servers. This means you can access and search your message history from any computer with access to the internet. Whether or not you use this feature, other users may choose to use it to save conversations with you in their account on Yahoo too. Your agreement to this License constitutes your consent to allow Yahoo to store these communications on its servers.

The foregoing software you elect to download, and any Yahoo or third party software, protocols (including but not limited to API protocols) (the "Software"), along with any services, content, or materials used that are authorized by Yahoo, are collectively deemed to be the "Service". Where the TOS references the defined term "Service," such terms in the TOS will also apply to the Software and services defined to be the "Service" under this License.

By registering and using Yahoo Messenger, you acknowledge that other users of the Service may elect to receive a notification from the Service when you sign on and may send you instant messages and other information via the Service. If you desire to block the notification feature of the Service sent to other users or if you don't want to receive messages from such users, you can enable the "Ignore" feature of the Service. The "Ignore" feature allows you to create a list of users you wish to block, which you can review and edit from time to time. Your ability to send and receive instant messages and other information may be blocked by Yahoo and by other users, which may partially or wholly limit your ability to use the Service. By using the Service, you agree that Yahoo has no responsibility for assessing or resolving any disputes arising from a user's ability to ignore, send messages, or otherwise use the Service.

FEES AND PAYMENTS

Yahoo reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Service, or other Yahoo services and web sites, in Yahoo's sole discretion. If Yahoo decides to charge fees, such charges will be disclosed to you prior.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL

In order to use the Service and those services and products within the Service (for both free and charged services), you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web or enable pc-to-pc, pc-to-phone, or other internet calling, including computers, modems, mobile devices, microphones, headsets, and handsets.

You may also use optional equipment to access the Service (e.g. a USB port phone device to access the pc-to-pc calling feature, which device may include dual functionality to access a traditional landline service which is not provided by Yahoo).
