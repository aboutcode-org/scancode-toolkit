All rights reserved.

This package has an explicit "all rights reserved" clause, or comes
without any license, or only with a disclaimer. This means that you
have only the rights that are granted to you by law. If you have
lawfully acquired a copy of the program (e.g., by buying it or by
downloading it from the author's site) then in many legislations you
are allowed to compile it, run it, make a backup, and to patch it as
necessary, without permission from the copyright holder.

Redistribution of the program is not allowed.

Disclaimer: Presumably, the above applies to the United States and
countries in the European Union at least. However, it is your own
responsibility to obey your country's laws.
