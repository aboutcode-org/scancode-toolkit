LICENSE

This code repository predates the concept of Open Source, and predates most
licenses along such lines. As such, the official license truly is:

EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, you cannot
claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. 

Using the code is permitted in any program, product, or library, non-commercial
or commercial. Giving credit is not required, though is a nice gesture.

The code comes as-is, and if there are any flaws or problems with any Gems code,
nobody involved with Gems - authors, editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to
be held responsible. Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free
comes with no guarantee.
