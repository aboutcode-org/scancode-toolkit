MOLMOL is a molecular graphics program for displaying, analysing, and
manipulating the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules,
with special emphasis on the study of protein or DNA structures determined
by NMR. The following is legal information pertaining to the use of the
MOLMOL program. It applies to all MOLMOL source files, executable (binary)
files, configuration files, documentation files contained in the official
MOLMOL archives. (Certain portions refer to custom versions of the
software, there are specific rules listed below for these versions also.)
All of these are referred to here as "the software".

all rights to these results and may use them for any purpose commercial or
noncommercial. When plots prepared by MOLMOL are used in lectures,
publications or other similar occasions, then a reference to the authors
and the following paper is to be made:

   macromolecular structures.

This software package and all of the files in this archive are copyrighted
by BRUKER/Spectrospin and ETH Zurich. They may only be distributed and/or
modified according to the guidelines listed below. The spirit of the
guidelines below is to provide the full MOLMOL package freely to as many
users as possible, prevent MOLMOL users and developers from being taken
advantage of, enhance the life quality of those who come in contact with
MOLMOL. This legal document was created so these goals could be realized.
You are legally bound to follow these rules, but we hope you will follow
them as a matter of ethics, rather than fear of litigation.

No portion of this package may be separated from the package and
distributed separately other than under the conditions specified in the
guidelines below.

This package may only be bundled in other software packages with the
explicit permission of the copyright holders.

This package may only be included in software compilations using media such
as, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical disks,
hard disks, or memory cards with the explicit permission of the copyright
holders.

The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source for
their own personal use in any fashion they see fit. What you do with the
software in your own home is your business.

If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the software,
documentation or other parts of the package (here after referred to as
a "custom version") they must follow the guidelines listed below. These
guidelines have been established to promote the growth of MOLMOL and
prevent difficulties for users and developers alike. Please follow them
carefully for the benefit of all concerned when creating a custom version.

You may not incorporate any portion of the MOLMOL source code in any
software other than a custom version of MOLMOL without the explicit
permission of the copyright holders. However authors who contribute source
to MOLMOL may still retain all rights to use their contributed code for any
purpose as described below.

The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the MOLMOL
authors, but the authors are in no way required to utilize these
enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the authors, the contributor
asserts that he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these
materials. He authorizes the MOLMOL authors to use the materials any way
they like. The contributor still retains rights to the donated material,
but by donating you grant equal rights to the MOLMOL authors. The MOLMOL
authors don't have to use the material, but if we do, you do not acquire
any rights related to MOLMOL. We will give you credit if applicable.


                    GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION

The permission to distribute this package under certain very specific
conditions is granted in advance, provided that the above and following
conditions are met.

These archives must not be re-archived using a different method without the
explicit permission of the authors. You may rename the archives only to
meet the file name conventions of your system or to avoid file name
duplications but we ask that you try to keep file names as similar to the
originals as possible.

You must distribute a full package of archives as described in the next
section.

Noncommercial distribution (such as a user copying the software for a
personal friend or colleague and not charging money or services for that
copy) has no other restrictions. All forms of commercial distribution
are only allowed with explicit permission of the copyright holders.

The copyright holders reserve the right to withdraw distribution privileges
from any group, individual, or organization for any reason.


                       DEFINITION OF "FULL PACKAGE"

MOLMOL is contained in 3 archives for each hardware platform. 1) An
executable archive, 2) A documentation archive, 3) Source code archive.

A "full package" is defined as one of the following bundle options:
   1  All archives (executable, docs, source)
   2  User archives (executable, docs but no source)
   3  Programmer archives (source, docs but no executable)

MOLMOL is officially distributed for SGI running IRIX; Sun running SunOS;
IBM running AIX; and DEC running Digital UNIX. Other systems may be added
in the future.

Distributors need not support all platforms but for each platform you
support you must distribute a full package.


              CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF ORIGINAL VERSION

On-line services may distribute the MOLMOL archives under the conditions
following this section.

The archives must all be easily available on the service and should be
grouped together in a similar on-line area.

It is strongly requested that operators remove prior versions of MOLMOL to
avoid user confusion and simplify or minimize our support efforts. They
should also notify the MOLMOL authors so that they can be informed about
new versions.

The on-line service may only charge standard usage rates for the time
required to download this software. A premium may not be charged for this
package.


              CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS

You may distribute custom compiled versions only if you comply with the
following conditions. These conditions also apply to custom documentation
based on our files.

     Mark your version clearly on all modified files stating this to be a
modified and unofficial version.
     Make all of your modifications to MOLMOL freely and publicly
available.
     You must provide all MOLMOL support for all users who use your custom
version. The MOLMOL authors are not obligated to provide you or your users
any technical support.
     You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that you
have made to the program that you are distributing.
     Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official
MOLMOL.
     Include contact and support information for your version. Include
this information in the printMsg() funtion of the source file MolMol.c
and insure that the program prominently displays this information. Include
all credits and credit screens for the official version.
     Include a copy of this document.


                                DISCLAIMER
