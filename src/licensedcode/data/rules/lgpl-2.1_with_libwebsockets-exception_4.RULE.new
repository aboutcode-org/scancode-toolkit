Libwebsockets and included programs are provided under the terms of the GNU
Library General Public License (LGPL) 2.1, with the following exceptions:

1) Any reference, whether in these modifications or in the GNU
Library General Public License 2.1, to this License, these terms, the
GNU Lesser Public License,  GNU Library General Public License, LGPL, or
any similar reference shall refer to the GNU Library General Public
License 2.1 as modified by these paragraphs 1) through 4).

2) Static linking of programs with the libwebsockets library does not
constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide 
source code for the program, use the shared libwebsockets libraries, or
link their program against a user-supplied version of libwebsockets.

If you link the program to a modified version of libwebsockets, then the
changes to libwebsockets must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
sections 1, 2, and 4.

3) You do not have to provide a copy of the libwebsockets license with
programs that are linked to the libwebsockets library, nor do you have to
identify the libwebsockets license in your program or documentation as
required by section 6 of the LGPL.

However, programs must still identify their use of libwebsockets. The
following example statement can be included in user documentation to
satisfy this requirement:

"[program] is based in part on the work of the libwebsockets  project
(https://libwebsockets.org)"

4) Some sources included have their own, more liberal licenses, or options
to get original sources with the liberal terms.
