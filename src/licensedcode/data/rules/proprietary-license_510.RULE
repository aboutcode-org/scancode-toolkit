# GitLab Security Alert Database Terms

Last Updated: May 16, 2019

Welcome to the GitLab, Inc. (“GitLab”) security alert database, which is made available via the website located at [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) (the “GitLab Security Alert Database”). Please read these terms and conditions (the “Security Alert Database Terms”) carefully because they govern your access to and use of the GitLab Security Alert Database, the security alert database, and all related information, data, and content made accessible via the GitLab Security Alert Database (collectively, the “Security Alert Database”).

## 1. Agreement to Security Alert Database Terms

By clicking “agree” or accessing or using the Security Alert Database, you agree to be bound by these Security Alert Database Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Security Alert Database Terms, do not attempt to access or use the Security Alert Database. If you are accessing or using the Security Alert Database on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Security Alert Database Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

## 2. Changes to Security Alert Database Terms or Security Alert Database

We may update the Security Alert Database Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the updated Security Alert Database Terms on the Gitlab Security Alert Database or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Security Alert Database Terms whenever we update them or you use the Security Alert Database. If you continue to use the Security Alert Database after we have posted updated Security Alert Database Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Security Alert Database Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the updated Security Alert Database Terms, then you may not use the Security Alert Database anymore. Because our Security Alert Database is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Security Alert Database, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
