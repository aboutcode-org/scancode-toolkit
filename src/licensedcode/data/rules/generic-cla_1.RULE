# uses a shared copyright model: each contributor holds copyright over
#their contributions to Caffe. The project versioning records all such
#contribution and copyright details. If a contributor wants to further mark
#their specific copyright on a particular contribution, they should indicate
#their copyright solely in the commit message of the change when it is
#committed.
