NOTE: Only certain parts of the ScummVM project are under the {{BSD license}}.
The majority of the files are under the {{GNU GPL.}} See the headers of the
individual files to find out the exact license.
The term "BSD license" refers to any {{BSD-like license}}, as they are sometimes
hard to tell apart. No slight against other licenses is intended.
