The 'core' of  (located in /core) is licensed under LGPLv3.
This just means that if you make any changes to how that code works,
you must release those changes under the LGPL.
If you just *use* , then you can use any license you want for your own code.

We don't feel that the restrictions imposed by the LGPL make sense for the
'non-core' functionality in (derivative code must *also* be LGPL or GPL),
especially for examples and utility code, so we have relicensed all 'non-core'
code under the more permissive BSD (specifically Modified BSD aka New BSD aka
3-clause BSD), where possible. This means that you can copy this code and build
your own apps without needing to license your own code with the LGPL or GPL.
