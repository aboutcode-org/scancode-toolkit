The library is released under the GPL with the following exception: Linking this
library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work
based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public
License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,
you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.

Note The exception is changed to reflect the latest GNU Classpath exception.
Older versions of #ziplib did have another exception, but the new one is clearer
and it doesn't break compatibility with the old one. Bottom line In plain
English this means you can use this library in commercial closed-source
applications.
