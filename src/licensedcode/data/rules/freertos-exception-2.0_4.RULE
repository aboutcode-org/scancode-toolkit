The FreeRTOS GPL exception text follows:

Any FreeRTOS *source code*, whether modified or in it's original release form,
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 1:

Linking FreeRTOS with other modules is making a combined work based on FreeRTOS.
Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License V2 cover the
whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of FreeRTOS give you permission to
link FreeRTOS with independent modules to produce a statically linked
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 2:

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including
the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the
express permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the
industry and is intended to ensure information accuracy).
