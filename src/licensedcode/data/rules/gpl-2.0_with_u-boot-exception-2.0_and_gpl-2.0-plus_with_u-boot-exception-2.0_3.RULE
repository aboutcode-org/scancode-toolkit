Even though U-Boot in general is covered by the GPL-2.0/GPL-2.0+,
this does *not* cover the so-called "standalone" applications that
use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided by U-Boot
exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered normal use of
U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
