      Software licensed under the GNU General Public License and/or under the
      GNU Lesser General Pubic License ("GPL Software"), a complete machine-
      readable copy of the GPL Software Source Code ("GPL Source Code") is
      either: (i) included with the Software that is delivered to You; or (ii)

      preceding options are available, you may download the GPL Source Code
      from the same website. Information about how to make a written request
      for GPL Source Code may be found in the ancillary.txt file or, if an

3. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VSI AND ITS SUPPLIERS
PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL
INDEMNITIES, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, WHETHER BY
STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK
OF VIRUSES. VSI DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF SOFTWARE WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

NOT APPLY TO YOU IN ITS ENTIRETY.
4. PARTICIPATION
In partial consideration of the license granted hereunder, you agree to provide
reasonable participation in the online Software community forums, including
without limitation such activities as answering questions and contributing
articles and how-to videos to the OpenVMS online Software community at https://
forum.vmssoftware.com.
5. FONT PROGRAMS
   1. The Software contains font software programs that generate human-readable
      typeface designs ("Font Programs"). You may not install or use the
      Font Programs on any device except one on which you have installed a
      properly licensed copy of the Software.
   2. The Font Programs are supplied solely to You for Non-commercial use only.
   3. You may not convert the Font Programs into a different format. You may
      not alter or modify the Font Programs in any manner that results in the
      Font Programs having different or enhanced functionality than when it was
      delivered to you as part of the Software.
   4. You may use an application program to embed the output of the Font
      Programs into an electronic document. You may send such an electronic
      document to a third party only for the purpose of permitting the third
      party to view and print the electronic document. Font Programs {{may not be}}
      embedded in any format that permits the recipient of an electronic
      document to install the Font Programs or to use the Font Programs for any
      purpose beyond merely viewing and printing the document. You may not
      embed Font Programs into a Commercial Product. A "Commercial Product"
      is an electronic document that is distributed in exchange for a fee or
      other consideration. For example, you cannot embed Font Programs into an
      electronic book or magazine that is offered to the public for a fee.
   5. Except for the print and view embedding permission granted in Section 5
      (d) above, you may not copy the Font Programs, provided, however, you may
      make one copy of the Font Programs for archival purposes only. The
      archival copy cannot be distributed and can be used only when you have
      permanently deleted the original or any copy of the Font Programs on your
      device. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or take any action which
      results in or designed to result in gaining access to the source code of
      the Font Programs, except as permitted by law and then only for the
      purpose of achieving an interoperable program
   6. The Font Programs supplied with the Software are proprietary and are
      protected by U.S. and international copyright and trademark law. All
      rights not expressly set forth herein are reserved. A breach of this End
      User License Agreement may subject you to damages and injunctive relief
      under this Agreement as well as under applicable copyright and trademark
      law.
   7. If you are acquiring Font Programs on behalf of any unit or agency of the
      United States Government, the following provisions shall apply. Use,
      duplication, or disclosure by the United States Government is subject to
      restrictions as set forth in the Rights in Technical Data and computer
      Software clause at FAR 252.227-7013, subdivision (b)(3)(ii) or
      subparagraph (c)(1(ii), as appropriate. Further use, duplication, or
      disclosure is subject to restrictions to restricted rights software as
      set forth in FAR 52.227-19(c)(2).
6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES FOR
BODILY INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), THE ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF VSI AND ANY
OF ITS SUPPLIERS RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS AGREEMENT, AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT
ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU SEPARATELY FOR THE SOFTWARE OR U.S. $5.00. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VSI OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES

REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, DOWNTIME COSTS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED
SAVINGS, LOSS, DISCLOSURE, UNAVAILABILITY OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, SOFTWARE
RESTORATION, OR LOSS OF PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE
OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF VSI OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE. SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.
7. TERMINATION
This Agreement is effective for twelve (12) months from installation of the
Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will also terminate
upon conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or if You fail to comply
with any term or condition hereof. Upon termination You will destroy the
Software and all copies of the Software or return them to VSI. You may retain
one copy of the Software subsequent to termination solely for archival purposes
only. Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7 will survive termination of this Agreement.
8. GENERAL
   1. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate, or otherwise transfer
      ("Assign") all or any part of this Agreement without prior written
      consent from VSI, payment to VSI of any applicable fees, and compliance
      with VSI's Software license transfer policies and any applicable third-
      party license terms. Any such attempted Assignment will be null and void.
      Where an authorized Assignment occurs in accordance with this Section,
      Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and You will immediately
      deliver the Software and all copies to the Assignee. The Assignee must
      agree in writing to the terms of this Agreement, and the transferee
      thereafter will be considered "You" for purposes of this Agreement.
      You may transfer firmware only upon transfer of the associated hardware.
   2. If the Software is licensed for use in the performance of a U.S.
      Government prime contract or subcontract, You agree that, consistent with
      FAR 12.211 and 12.212, commercial computer Software, computer Software

      VSI's standard commercial license.
   3. To the extent You export, re-export, or import Software, technology, or
      technical data licensed or provided hereunder, You assume sole
      responsibility for complying with applicable laws and regulations and for
      obtaining required export and import authorizations. VSI may suspend
      performance if You are in violation of any applicable laws or
      regulations.
   4. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.,
      excluding rules as to choice and conflict of law. You and VSI agree that
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
      Goods will not apply to this Agreement.
   5. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this
      Agreement is the entire agreement between VSI and You regarding Your Use
      of the Software, and supersedes and replaces any previous communications,
      representations, or agreements, or Your additional or inconsistent terms,
      whether oral or written. In the event any provision of this Agreement is
      held invalid or unenforceable VSI's failure to exercise or delay in
      exercising any of its rights under this Agreement will not constitute or
      be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of those rights.
