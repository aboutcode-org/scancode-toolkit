Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject
to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version
2, but only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source
file's header the words

"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole
combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms
of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent
module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An
independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on
this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception
to your version of the library,  but you are not obligated to do so. If
you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
