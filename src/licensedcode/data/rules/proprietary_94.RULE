LICENSE
Under this Software License Agreement (the "Agreement"), David Muse (the "Vendor") grants the user (the "Licensee") a non-exclusive and non-transferable license (the "License") to install and use the SQL Relay Enterprise Modules (the "Software") and install one or more license keys (the "License Keys") which enable the Software to function.

The Software includes the executable computer programs and any other files that may accompany the product.

The License Keys are codes provided by the Vendor or by an agent of the Vendor, each consisting of four 4-digit numbers, separated by dashes.  At the Vendor's discretion, one or more License Keys may be required to be installed, as directed by the Vendor, to enable the Software to function.

Title, copyright, intellectual property rights and distribution rights of the Software and License Keys remain exclusively with the Vendor.  This Agreement constitutes a license for use only and is not in any way a transfer of ownership rights to the Software or License Keys.

The Software may be installed into any number of locations.

Each of the License Keys may be installed only once, into one location.  A single copy of each of the License Keys may be made for backup purposes only.  Once installed, the License Keys may enable the Software to function on no more than one computing node, whether physical or virtual machine, or any other type of computing node.  Once installed, the License Keys may not be copied, shared, or otherwise distributed such that they may enable the Software to function on more than one computing node, whether physical or virtual machine, or any other type of computing node.

The rights and obligations of this Agreement are personal rights granted to the Licensee only.  The Licensee may not transfer or assign any of the rights or obligations to any other person or legal entity.

The Software and License Keys may not be modified, de-compiled, or reverse-engieered in any manner using technologies available now or in the future.

Failure to comply with any of the terms under this License section will be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

LICENSE FEE
The original purchase price paid by the Licensee for the License Keys will constitute the entire license fee and is the full consideration for this Agreement.

TERMINATION
Without prejudice to any other rights, the Vendor may terminate this Agreement if Licensee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the Software and License Keys.

NO WARRANTIES
The Vendor expressly disclaims any warranty for the Software and License Keys. The Software and License Keys and any related documentation is provided â€œas isâ€ without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Software and License Keys remains with you.

NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES.
In no event shall the Vendor be liable for any special, consequential, incidental or indirect damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software or License Keys, even if the Vendor of the Software and License Keys is aware of the possibility of such damages and known defects.
