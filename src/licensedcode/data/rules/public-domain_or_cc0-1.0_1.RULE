This code is placed in the public domain as far as allowed by law, parts (if any) that cannot be relased in the public domain are irrevocably licensed to all readers under the Creative Commons license without restrictions ... but if you improve it it would be great if you could share it. 
The code uses a base N decoder plucked from the web somewhere (can't find it) that was also public domain.
