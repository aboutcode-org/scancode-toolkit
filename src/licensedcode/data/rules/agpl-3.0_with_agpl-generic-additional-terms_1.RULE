ADDITIONAL TERMS PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 OF AGPLv3
GlobaLeaks is an open-source whistleblowing framework distributed under the GNU
Affero GPL v3 License terms, with Additional Terms pursuant to Section 7 of said
license.

This Program was created by Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human
Rights (https://www.hermescenter.org) and by Whistleblowing Solutions I.S. SRL
(https://www.whistleblowingsolutions.it) under the name "GlobaLeaks"
(https://www.globaleaks.org).

The purpose of Hermes (as a nonprofit association) and of Whistleblowing
Solutions (as non-profit social enterprise) is to support the development of
the GlobaLeaks software while maintaining it as free software available for
public-interest purposes which include protecting whistleblowers and increasing
transparency.

We strongly believe in free software and open source distribution, since it
guarantees easy and reasonable access to innovative software to a large
community of users.

We wish to recognize and attribute GlobaLeaks to its authors, regardless of its
present or later use, modification, distribution or adaption. Accordingly,
these terms aim to preserve the Hermes Center and Whistleblowing Solutions
I.S. S.r.l moral rights over the software.

We wish all the modified editions of the GlobaLeaks software redistributed to
be kept always up-to-date with the official version and its security
improvements and fixes.

We strongly believe that the community will be positively affected by these
terms, the ultimate goal of which is to ensure the security and sustainability
of free and open source software by supporting R&D and improving the visibility
of GlobaLeaks as free and open source software, while encouraging others to
comply with our common ideals.

Pursuant to this license, you are therefore free to use the software and
modify it according to the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 and
the Additional Terms.

Following are the applicable Additional Terms for Use of GlobaLeaks pursuant to
section 7, subsections (b) and (c) of the GNU Affero General Public License
version 3.

ADDITIONAL TERMS PURSUANT TO SECTION 7(b) OF AGPLv3

Pursuant to Section 7(b) of the AGPLv3, we require the preservation of the legal
notices, copyright notices and author attributions in the program and in its
documentation or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing
it.

The Program displays such notices in each user interface screen with an author
attribution that includes "Powered by GlobaLeaks".

For works containing the Program or any covered work, each interactive user
interface must include a prominent and conveniently accessible feature for the
display of Appropriate Legal Notices. This display must include author
attributions and copyright notices as found in the Program. This display of
these author attributions must be convenient for a user wishing to browse
credits, shown in a manner separate and distinct from license texts, and
commensurately prominent with respect to other author attributions.
To the extent that it is technically feasible and not obtrusive, the graphical
form of these author attributions, such as a "Powered by GlobaLeaks" logo, must
be preserved; otherwise, a textual equivalent is permitted. When users click on
the "Powered by GlobaLeaks" logo it must direct them back to the
https://www.globaleaks.org website.

We require the Appropriate Legal Notices to be preserved clearly visible with
size of the fonts and icons proportionate to the user interface being used.

Any party that wishes to remove the author attribution from the user interfaces
is required to obtain written consent from Whistleblowing Solutions I.S. SRL.

              ADDITIONAL TERMS PURSUANT TO SECTION 7(c) OF AGPLv3
Pursuant to Section 7(c) of the AGPLv3, we require that modified versions of the
material should be marked in a reasonable way as different from the official
version.

Any modified material being redistributed must have the program display the
Modified Material Notice in each user interface screen including the statement
"This server is running a modified version of the GlobaLeaks software version
VERSION_NUMBER released on RELEASE_DATE. Download the modified version of the
source code." with a clearly visible hyperlink that provides access to the
source code of the modified software.

The string VERSION_NUMBER should be replaced with the exact version number of
the official GlobaLeaks software on which the modified material is based.
The string RELEASE_DATE should be replaced with the full date of the release of
the version VERSION_NUMBER of the official GlobaLeaks software on which the
modified material is based.

Whenever the modified material being redistributed is not up-to-date with the
official GlobaLeaks software within 6 months from the date of first subsequent
official release on which it is based, the Modified Material Notice must read
"This server is running a modified version of the GlobaLeaks software
VERSION_NUMBER released on RELEASE_DATE, which has not been updated for more
than 6 months and might include security vulnerabilities. Download the modified
version of the source code." with a clearly visible hyperlink that provides
access to the source code of the modified software.

When a user clicks on the "Download the modified version of the source code"
(or the equivalent localized language version of the sentence) it must direct
the user to an archive file containing the modified version of the source code
or to an intermediate web page containing a hyperlink to directly download an
archive file of the modified source code from a Web browser.
