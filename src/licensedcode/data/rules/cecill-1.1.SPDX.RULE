FREE SOFTWARE LICENSING AGREEMENT CeCILL
========================================


Notice
------


This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of discussions
between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main
principles guiding its drafting:
- firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of
torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers
to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
- secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free
software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.

The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :
CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and
industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33
rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

PREAMBLE
--------


The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the
right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license
within the framework of an "open source" distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for
users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent
redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing
the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may 
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means 
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
the Software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions
enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security.
This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. 

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case
basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as
