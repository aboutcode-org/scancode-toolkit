This driver consists of two parts.  The first part  provides
the basic interfaces, is derived in part from the driver and
 drivers, and is covered by the GPL.  The second part 
provides the code to program the hardware.  Most of it is derived from
the  XFree86 driver.  The HW-specific code is covered here
under a dual license (GPL and MIT/XFree86 license).
