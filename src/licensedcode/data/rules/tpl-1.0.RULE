a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (1) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (2) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.

8.3.

8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.
