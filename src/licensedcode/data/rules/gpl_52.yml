notes: |
    No version is specified in this notice found in ansiknr.c as redistributed
    with automake in this RPM

    http://vault.centos.org/6.7/os/Source/SPackages/automake-1.11.1-4.el6.src.rpm 

    The original tarball for automake found in this RPM contains a GPL 2.0 text
    at the top-level and a GPL 3.0 text at the same level as ansiknr.c. Since
    ansiknr.c copyright pre-dates the GPL 3.0 and the notice has no version
    stated, this rule is defined to match a bare GPL rather than a GPL 3.0. GPL
    3.0 is the license for automake proper and unlikely the license for
    ansiknr.c.
