OpenJDK Trademark Notice

Version 1.2O, 2011/11/11

OpenJDK (the "Name") is a trademark of Oracle America, Inc. ("Oracle")
 (the "Trademark Owner").

Trademark Owner publishes source code (the "Original Software") at
 several World Wide Web locations (each a "Website").  These locations
 include:

    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk6
    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk7
    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk8
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8

as well as any successor locations designated by Trademark Owner in
 future revisions of this Notice.

Each Website provides Original Software in two parts: A Java virtual
 machine (the "Virtual Machine") and an API library and tools (the
 "Library and Tools").

Trademark Owner permits any person obtaining a copy of this software
 (the "Software") that is based on Original Software to use the Name
 in the package names and version strings of the Software subject to
 the following conditions:

  (1) The Software is a substantially complete implementation of the
       OpenJDK development kit or runtime environment source code
       retrieved from a single Website, and the vast majority of the
       Software code is identical to that upstream Original Software,
       except that:

        (a) Changes required to port Original Software to new
             operating systems or hardware architectures are permitted,
             so long as that work takes place in the context of an
             approved Project hosted in the OpenJDK Community; and

        (b) A Virtual Machine from one Website may be combined with the
             Library and Tools of another Website, so long as the vast
             majority of the code in each is identical to the
             corresponding upstream Virtual Machine or Library and
             Tools component.

  (2) No permission is hereby granted to use the Name in any other manner,
       unless such use constitutes "fair use", for example "based on the
       OpenJDK source code" or "DistroXYZ's packaging of the OpenJDK 6
       code".

  (3) Trademark Owner makes no warranties of any kind respecting the Name,
       and all representations and warranties, including any implied
       warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or
       non-infringement are hereby disclaimed.

  (4) Finally, this notice and the following legend are included in all
       copies of the Software or portions of it:

     Java and OpenJDK are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle
      and/or its affiliates.

Trademark Owner intends to revise this Notice as necessary in order to
 meet the needs of the OpenJDK Community.  Revisions to this notice
 will be announced on the public mailing list announce at
 openjdk.java.net, to which you may subscribe by visiting
 http://mail.openjdk.java.net.  Please send questions or comments about
 this Notice to the discuss list at the same location.
