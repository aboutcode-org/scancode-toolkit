Ninject.Web.Mvc is intended to be used in both open-source and commercial environments. To allow its use in as many
situations as possible, Ninject is dual-licensed. You may choose to use Ninject.Web.Mvc under either the Apache License,
Version 2.0, or the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL). These licenses are essentially identical, but you are
encouraged to evaluate both to determine which best fits your intended use.
