All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the {{public domain}} by the authors. All code authors, and
representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the {{public domain}} and
originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish,
use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.
