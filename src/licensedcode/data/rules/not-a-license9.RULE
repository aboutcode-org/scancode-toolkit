One implication of this ownership structure is that any attempt to change
the licensing of the kernel is doomed to almost certain failure.  There are
few practical scenarios where the agreement of all copyright holders could
be obtained (or their code removed from the kernel).  So, in particular,
there is no prospect of a migration to version 3 of the GPL in the
foreseeable future.
