MySQL FOSS License Exception

We want free and open source software applications under certain licenses to be
able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL Connector (specified GPL-licensed MySQL
client libraries) despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and conditions of the GPLv2
as applied to these client libraries, which are identified and described in more
detail in the FOSS License Exception at
<http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>
