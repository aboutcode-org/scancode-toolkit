on which your code is based. It also includes numerous fixes among them being the
ability to handle a lot of 'broken' TIFFs."

Note that numerous fixes were applied to the code used in iText by Paulo Soares,
but apart from the fixes there were no essential changes between the code that
was originally adapted and the code that is now available under the following

The main difference can be found in the final paragraph: the restriction
that the source code is not "licensed" in this particular situation has
been removed.
