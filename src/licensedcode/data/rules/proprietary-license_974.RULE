End User License Agreement (EULA)

1. Introduction
1.1 General information
This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between "you" (either an individual or a legal entity, hereinafter referred to as "Licensee" or "Customer") and   (" " or "Licensor") (each individually a "Party" and collectively the "Parties") for your use of   software products. The Agreement sets forth all rights and obligations for both Licensee and   and governs your use of all Software Products installed or provided by  . Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein. By paying the applicable license fee(s) and by downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable against you in the same manner as a written, negotiated contract signed by you. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized and may not download, install, or use any   Software Products. 

In order to use the   software products and services, the Licensee must have the following:
(a) a so-called valid Subscription Agreement or 
(b) a valid license from  .
Furthermore, individual software products require and use
a) which are based on a subscription agreement and/or
b) with a server-based license solution
a secure connection of the application computer to the   infrastructure and/or the "Cloud Services". 
1.2 The Licensor is   The Licensee is the end customer. The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the "Software Product", which includes the specific software program and the associated licensed software modules, subsequent extensions, updates, patches, and associated documentation for internal company operation, as well as the associated manuals and software documentation. 
1.3 Essential definitions, descriptions, and explanations for different release types of Licensor's software products.
Major release (deliverable medium) means a new version of the software application with new or changed functionalities. A new major version can typically be released once or even several times per year.
Innovation Release / BETA Software refers to an intermediate version of the software application with new or changed functionalities. A new interim version is released one or more times between two major releases:
Innovation releases are only available to customers with a valid software maintenance agreement;
No patch or service pack is provided for an innovation release;
Only the current innovation release is valid;
There is no backward compatibility with previous major or innovation releases.
Service Pack / Hotfix (deliverable medium) refers to a summary of patches. The advantage of this is that several bugs can be fixed by performing a single installation. As a rule, a service pack contains all patches (unless they have become obsolete) since the release of the last major release or since the last published service pack. In the case of cumulative service packs, only the latest one needs to be installed by the customer because it contains the previous patches:
Service packs contain bug fixes. However, they do not contain any new functionalities;
Service packs go through a release process and are created at regular intervals;
In the spirit of warranty, a series of service packs are made available for each major release of software;
Service Packs are available to all Customers who may use the applicable Major Revision, regardless of Software Maintenance Agreement Contract Customer status; 
Patch deliverable) means an update to a major revision to correct one or a few bugs. Patches are cumulative in structure. This means that a new patch contains all the changes from the previous patches. 
Patches are only created if there is an urgent bug fix for one or more customers. Patches are distributed by Software Support to the respective affected customers or made available as a download on the   portal.
A bug fix refers to an error correction for a specific software error. Bug fixes are not delivered separately, but always in the form of patches, service packs or new major releases.
An update/upgrade is defined as a change to a new major version / major release 
Continuous Release refers to the continuous and agile provision of error corrections and functional changes or enhancements. There is no distinction between the different versioning types of major release, innovation release, service pack and patch.
Setup/Installer is provided via download and contains the full functionality of the main version, which can be unlocked step by step if necessary.
Freeware is software that is provided free of charge for use in perpetuity.
Freeware with registration is a free software, which contains extended functionalities of the freeware by a registration of the licensee and is left temporally limited.
Trial version is a time-limited, free transfer of the main version of the software.
Software Maintenance Agreement is an additional agreement between the Licensor and the Licensee which, among other things, covers the maintenance / restoration of the operational readiness of the Software, its updating, consulting as well as maintenance of the Software including documentation.

1.4 Essential definitions, descriptions, and explanations for different models of payment for   software products

a.) 7-year model: The Licensee acquires a seven-year   Software right of use (for details see Clause 2.1.) of the respective major release of the Software product in accordance with this License Agreement by paying a one-time fee. In addition, the Licensee may conclude a Software Maintenance Agreement which grants additional privileges. The Licensor shall charge an ongoing fee for the Software Maintenance Agreement. 
b.) Subscription model: Licensee acquires the right to use the respective major release of the software product in accordance with this license agreement for a fixed period of time, the so-called subscription term. In addition, certain services (hotline support and the right to use the latest version) may be included in a Subscription model and are not offered in separate Software Maintenance Agreements. The Licensor charges a Subscription Fee per Subscription Term.

1.5 Essential definitions, descriptions, and explanations for different license models for the Licensor's software products.
Concurrent Use / Floating Licenses may be used by more than one User or Instance. The number of users with the right to use the licensed software product at the same time is governed by the number of concurrent use / floating licenses, if the software product
(a) is installed on a server and is started by a user from another computer that is part of the same internal network as the file server, or 
(b) is installed on a user's computer but is available for use only if that user's computer can access it from a file server over an internal network; or 
(c) is installed on a computer for a limited period of time through a documented / controlled "license check-out process" (borrowing of the license), which ensures that the number of licenses in the network is automatically reduced / adjusted. This includes automatic return of the granted license at the end of the period specified in the system or manual license return at an earlier time.
Concurrent Use Licenses are available as (a) factory-bound Concurrent Use Licenses or (b) global Concurrent Use Licenses. Global Concurrent Use Licenses are subject to higher fees than Factory Concurrent Use Licenses.
(d) Provided that the licenses are available on a server, the software can be used on premise.
Single Use License means a license that limits the right to use the Software Product to a particular instance on which the Software Product is used and/or to a particular person who uses the Software.
1.6 If the Software Product is identified by Licensor as an "Update", "Upgrade", "Patch" or "Subscription", Licensee must have the Software Product License identified by Licensor as appropriate for the Update, Upgrade or Patch in order to use the Software Product. A Software Product identified by Licensor as an Update, Upgrade or Patch replaces and/or enhances the original Product that served as the basis for the Update and Upgrade. Licensee may use the respective upgrade or patch only in accordance with the terms of this License Agreement. If the Software Product is an upgrade of a component of a software package licensed as a single product, Licensee may use and transfer the Software Product only as a component of that single product package. Licensee is not permitted to split it for use on multiple computers. 
A valid Subscription Agreement entitles the Licensee to use the latest software product by default.

1.7 The Software Product may contain codes, objects and other intellectual property developed by licensors or third parties and licensed by them and integrated into the Software Product ("Embedded Third Party Software"). Any Embedded Third Party Software or open source code and open source licenses used shall not limit or impair the rights of use granted to Licensee and may be accessed at any time within the respective software used. In individual cases, the respective license conditions can be provided by the Licensor upon request at any time. 

1.8 Any terms and conditions of purchase of the Licensee that conflict with or deviate from this Agreement shall not become part of the Agreement, even if the Licensor does not expressly object to them. Amendments to the EULA must be expressly agreed in writing by both parties.

2. Term and termination
2.1 In the 7-year model, this License Agreement and the right of use shall become legally effective upon payment of the license fees to the Licensor (Effective Date).
The license agreement shall commence, with the exception of license agreements limited in time, on the date specified in the licensor's order confirmation (effective date) or on the entry date specified by the licensee in the agreement (effective date). If two effective dates exist at the time of the agreement, the effective date specified by Licensee in an agreement in text form shall prevail. This License Agreement and with it the right of use shall automatically terminate seven (7) years after the Effective Date.
If additional Concurrent Users are added after payment of the initial license fee, the term for their use of the Software Product will terminate at the previously existing term in effect at the current time. If Licensee purchases an Upgrade, the term of this License Agreement will continue on the basis set forth in the new Upgrade License and Authorization Document.

2.2 In the Subscription Model, this License Agreement shall commence on the first day of the Subscription Term specified in Licensor's order confirmation (Effective Date) or on the entry date specified by Licensee in an agreement (in text form) (Effective Date). If two effective dates exist at the time of the agreement, the effective date specified by Licensee in an agreement (in text form) shall prevail. To the extent automatic renewals are permitted in Licensee's country, region, province or state, this Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term or one year, whichever is shorter ("Extended Subscription Term"), if the Subscription Agreement is not timely terminated. Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Licensee of the extension. Upon any renewal, the prices in effect on the first day of the new Subscription Term will be in effect. Licensee will be notified of any price increases, if any, in the course of notifying Licensee of the renewal. 
The subscription model will be fee-based either
a) on the Effective Date, if Customer has not purchased any additional services for setup that are explicitly related to the Subscription Product in question and that are an indispensable technical prerequisite for Software use by Licensee, or
b) after   has set up the Service for the Customer, which were explicitly acquired in connection with the Subscription Product in question and which are an indispensable technical prerequisite for Software use by the Licensee (e.g. installation).
Subsequent purchases under an existing subscription agreement will be billed on a pro-rated daily basis for the remainder of the current subscription period. 
If a new Subscription Period begins as a result of an automatic renewal of the Subscription Agreement, the fee for the agreed services, including additional purchases, will be charged for the originally agreed duration of the new Subscription Period. 

2.3 In the Subscription Model, this License Agreement may be terminated by Licensee vis-à-vis Licensor as follows:
a) thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Subscription Period, if a Subscription Period of one year was selected at the beginning,
b) fourteen (14) days prior to the end of the current month, if a subscription period of one month was selected at the beginning, or
c) fourteen (14) days prior to the effective date of an announced price increase,
online via the respective   portal for registered users, by registered mail or e-mail. Termination shall take effect upon expiry of the Subscription period selected at the beginning, with which the right of use also ends, or in the event of termination in accordance with Clause 2.3.c on the date of the price increase.
2.4 The Licensor shall be entitled to terminate this License Agreement and the corresponding rights of use with immediate effect if the Licensee violates any provision of this License Agreement or tacitly tolerates a violation of this License Agreement by third parties or fails to fulfill its obligations under this License Agreement or if the Licensee files for insolvency or a change of control occurs at the Licensee.
2.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 2 and unless otherwise agreed in this License Agreement, this License Agreement shall terminate automatically upon Licensee's breach of any of its provisions. In addition, unless otherwise agreed (e.g. in the case of Concurrent Use/Floating Licenses), this License Agreement shall terminate automatically if Licensee transfers possession of the Software Product or a copy of the Software to a third party (Sections 4.3 to 4.6) or sells the computer or measuring device on which the Software Product is installed to a third party. The right to use the previous version(s) ends with the installation of the Update or Upgrade. The Licensee is no longer entitled to use the previous version(s) on another computer system or to make one or more previous versions available for use by third parties.
2.6 Under no circumstances are license fees fully or partially refundable upon termination or mutually agreed termination of this Agreement unless   is responsible for the early termination of this Agreement.

5.1 Multiple use of the Software is possible depending on the type of licensing (concurrent use / floating licenses as dongle or PC-bound license). Only in case of emergency may the Licensee use the Software on alternative devices of the same type. 
Multiple use of the software product must be approved by the Licensor or requires the purchase of Concurrent Use / Floating Licenses. In the case of Concurrent Use / Floating Licenses, the total number of concurrently authorized users of the Software Product shall not exceed the number of all Concurrent Use Licenses granted to Licensee for the Software Product. Unless otherwise agreed in this License Agreement, all other terms and conditions of this License Agreement apply to Licensee's use of the Software Product under a Concurrent Use License. 
5.2 If the Licensee wishes to continue using the software product that has been replaced by an update or upgrade in parallel with the current software product, he/she requires the prior consent of the Licensor for this, unless this results from the purchased licenses; a pdf copy of the consent is to be sent to the specified e-mail address. 

6. Back translation and program changes 
6.1 As a matter of principle, the Licensee may not make any changes to the Software Product unless this is necessary to correct errors. The prerequisite is that this is done solely for the purpose of correcting errors that impair the functioning of the software. 
In the latter case and if important program functions and working methods could be disclosed during the repair process, Licensee may commission a commercially active third party to carry out the repair if this third party is not a potential competitor of Licensor. 
6.2 The reverse translation of the licensed program code into other code forms (decompilation) and other types of reverse engineering of various different phases of software creation are permitted only to the extent that they serve to correct errors that impair the functioning of the software (in accordance with Section 6.1). However, Licensee may perform such decompilation only to the extent necessary for correction and, if applicable, in compliance with the terms and conditions contractually agreed with the owner of the copyright in this Program.
Further, decompilation is permitted in cases to obtain information necessary for interoperability with an independently created computer program and only if such information cannot be obtained otherwise.

7.3 The Licensor shall correct errors in the Software Product, and in all manuals and other documents, within a reasonable period of time after receiving from the Licensee the corresponding information on the error necessary for the correction of the error. Errors shall be remedied by rectification, which shall not be invoiced, or by replacement of the delivery, at Licensor's option. 
7.4 The Licensee's right of termination due to the non-executability of the Software Product may only be exercised after rectifications or replacements have been made twice without success. 
7.5 The Licensor neither warrants nor guarantees the functionality of the measurement plans or programs created by third parties or the Licensee / Customer, nor the error-free execution of the measurement plans or programs with the Software or on the Licensor's systems. The Licensor excludes any form of warranty or guarantee with regard to third-party measurement plans and programs, especially after the implementation of software upgrades or new program versions. 
Licensor particularly emphasizes the possibility that the presence of one or more of the factors described below may cause a loss or change in performance with respect to measurement plans: 
a.) The operating system of the computer was changed between software revisions; 
b.) significant changes to the calculation algorithms; 
c.) Correction of software errors and malfunctions; 
d.) Changes in dependencies between software options; 
e.) incorrect programming of measurement plans; 
f.) influence of software programs or modules not issued by the Licensor. 

8. Liability 
8.1 If Licensee is unable to use the Software Product in the manner specified in the Agreement and Licensee is responsible for this due to the failure to implement or the incorrect implementation of suggestions and advice before or after signing the Agreement or due to the breach of other contractual obligations, the provisions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the exclusion of any further claims by Licensee.
For damages that do not occur to the software product, respectively not to the hardware and the connected device, the liability obligation of the licensor applies exclusively in the following cases, regardless of the respective legal ground:

- culpable damage to life, limb and health, in the event of errors, 
  which the Licensor has fraudulently concealed or which it has excluded under warranty, 
- Software errors within the scope of liability for personal injury and property damage due to personally implemented objects, as set out in the product liability regulations applicable to them. 
8.2 In the event of culpable breach of material contractual obligations, the Licensor shall also be liable for gross negligence on the part of non-executive employees and for slight negligence. In the latter case, liability shall be limited to damages that are foreseeable and typical for this type of contract. 
8.3 In addition, the Licensor, its employees and its vicarious agents shall be liable for data loss or changes due to program errors, limited to the extent that this would have been unavoidable if the Licensee had complied with its obligation to make back-up copies regularly and at least once a day. 
8.4 In the event of claims based on copyright infringement, the Licensor shall grant the Licensee the right to continue using the Software Product or to make modifications to the Software Product so that copyright protection is ensured. If this is not commercially reasonable, the Licensor shall take back the subject matter of the agreement and refund the license fee paid, less an amount corresponding to the duration of the previous use. This shall apply provided that Licensee notifies Licensor of this type of claim in writing without delay and allows Licensor all legal remedies and out-of-court settlements. 
8.5 The Licensee or its IT provider shall be liable for server interruptions, interruption of license allocation and other support cases that are not clearly attributable to an incorrectly created license with respect to Concurrent Use / Floating Licenses.
The Licensee or its IT provider is responsible for maintaining the necessary number of licenses to provide its services. The licensor is not liable for interruptions in use and subsequent work / production stoppages.
8.6 Further liability claims of the Licensee are expressly excluded. 
8.7 The Licensee is responsible for all problems arising from the use of the Software Product that are not directly caused by the Licensor.

10.5 The Licensee is expressly advised that it may not use the Software Product after termination of the License Agreement and that failure to comply with this requirement constitutes an infringement of copyright. Clause 9.3 shall also apply after termination of the contractual relationship. 

11. Data acquisition
11.1 Upon installation of the Software Product, depending on the Software Product, diagnostic as well as technical, usage-relevant and related information, including unique system and hardware identifiers, as well as information about the system software used, software license and modules as well as all devices and communications controlled by the Software (collectively referred to as "Systemic Data") shall be recorded locally on Licensee's computer or the technical prerequisite for the recording of the aforementioned information by Licensee shall be prepared if necessary; at of the respective specified  or in the respective software product, a detailed overview of the recorded data can be viewed. Depending on the application and configuration case, however, this data can also be stored locally in the network or on servers located in the network to enable further products or services of the Licensor. 
The Licensor is entitled to use this systemic data for diagnostic purposes or for Licensor Services and to record the data, provided that it is collected and stored for the purposes described above in a form that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about individuals. 
Depending on the software product, data collection can be prevented by uninstalling the analysis software. 
11.2 Floating Licenses: Upon request, the Licensee is obligated to make available up to twice a year extracts for license use. These must show 
- how many users the licenses
- how often 
- In which country 
- in which plant (only for plant-based concurrent use / floating licenses / server-based network-based licenses)
used in the period of the year preceding the date of the license server extract.
In this context, the Licensor reserves the right to request the sending of corresponding log files.
If Licensee fails to comply with this request even after repeated requests with a reasonable deadline, Licensor shall be entitled to review the use within the scope of the following paragraph at Licensee's expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Licensor shall be entitled to review compliance with the License Agreement at its own expense and to commission a review for up to one year after termination of the License Agreement. For this purpose, the Licensor shall commission an independent accountant or auditor from an internationally recognized auditing firm, who shall be subject to confidentiality obligations. The review shall be announced at least 30 days in advance and shall take place during normal business hours in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's normal business operations. Licensee shall promptly provide the accountant or auditor with all information that the accountant or auditor may reasonably request to assist in the review.
