This software component is {{licensed under the LGPL 3.0}} (see below). But for your entertainment, here are the previous ad-hoc terms. Note that I'd still appreciate $$, and please do still file a bug report if any of those scenarios occur.

The compiled product may be used commercially but a donation would be greatly appreciated if you do so. If you happen to make over $1 million with this software as part of your product though... come on, don't be stingy!

Liability: Computers are complex devices with many different configurations which run in many environments. While the program works well on my computer and in my environment, I have no way to guarantee that it will work perfectly on your computer, or that it won't delete your data, cause your computer to burst into flames, create a glitch in the matrix, become sentient and lock the pod bay doors, summon Cthulu, or kill Schr√∂dinger's cat. As such, you are using this software at your own risk. But if any of these things happen, please file a bug report.
