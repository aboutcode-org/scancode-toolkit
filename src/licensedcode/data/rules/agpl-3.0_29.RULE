If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,
you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.
For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a
"Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways
you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.
