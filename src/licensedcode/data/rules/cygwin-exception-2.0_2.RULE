    *** NOTE ***
    In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose
    sources are distributed under a license that complies with the Open
    Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without libcygwin.a
    itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.
    This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
    and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
    libcygwin.a linked into it. Note that this does not apply to the cygwin
    DLL itself. If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the DLL
    you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources
    for the cygwin DLL.
    See http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise Open Source
    Definition referenced above.
    Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to
    provide their application in open source code form. For more
