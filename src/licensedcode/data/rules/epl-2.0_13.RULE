      BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
      LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,

    <h2 id="general">7. GENERAL</h2>
    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
      parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
      necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
      (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
      infringes such Recipient s patent(s), then such Recipient s rights granted
      under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    </p>
    <p>All Recipient s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
      comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
      does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
      aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient s rights under this Agreement
      terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program
      as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient s obligations under
      this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the
      Program shall continue and survive.
