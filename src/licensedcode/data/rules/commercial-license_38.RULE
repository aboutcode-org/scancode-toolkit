EGENIX.COM COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT VERSION 1.0.0

1. Introduction

This "License Agreement" is between eGenix.com Software, Skills and Services GmbH ("eGenix.com"), having an office at Pastor-Loeh-Str. 48, D-40764 Langenfeld, Germany, and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using this software in source or binary form and its associated documentation ("the Software").

2. Terms and Definitions

The "Software" covered under this License Agreement includes without limitation, all object code, source code, help files, publications, documentation and other programs, products or tools that are included in the official "Software Distribution" available from eGenix.com.

The "Proof of Authorization" for the Software is a written and signed notice from eGenix.com providing evidence of the extent of authorizations the Licensee has acquired to use the Software and of Licensee's eligibility for future upgrade program prices (if announced) and potential special or promotional opportunities. As such, the Proof of Authorization becomes part of this License Agreement.

Installation of the Software ("Installation") refers to the process of unpacking or copying the files included in the Software Distribution to an Installation Target.

"Installation Target" refers to the target of an installation operation. Targets are defined as follows:

1) "CPU" refers to a central processing unit which is able to store and/or execute the Software (a server, personal computer, or other computer-like device) using at most two (2) processors,

2) "Site" refers to at most one hundred fifty (150) CPUs installed at a single site of a company,

3) "Corporate" refers to at most one thousand (1000) CPUs installed at an unlimited number of sites of the company,

4) "Developer CPU" refers to a single CPU used by at most one (1) developer.

When installing the Software on a server CPU for use by other CPUs in a network, Licensee must obtain a License for the server CPU and for all client CPUs attached to the network which will make use of the Software by copying the Software in binary or source form from the server into their CPU memory. If a CPU makes use of more than two (2) processors, Licensee must obtain additional CPU licenses to cover the total number of installed processors. Likewise, if a Developer CPU is used by more than one developer, Licensee must obtain additional Developer CPU licenses to cover the total number of developers using the CPU.

"Commercial Environment" refers to any application environment which is aimed at producing profit. This includes, without limitation, for-profit organizations, work as independent contractor, consultant and other profit generating relationships with organizations or individuals.

"Non-Commercial Environments" are all those application environments which do not directly or indirectly generate profit. Educational and other officially acknowledged non-profit organizations are regarded as being a Non-Commercial Environment in the above sense.
