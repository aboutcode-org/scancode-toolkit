If you want to distribute modified versions of qmail (including ports, 
 no matter how minor the changes are) you'll have to get my approval. 
 This does not mean approval of your distribution method, your intentions, 
 your e-mail address, your haircut, or any other irrelevant information. 
 It means a detailed review of the exact package that you want to distribute.

Exception: You are permitted to distribute a precompiled var-qmail package if 
(1) installing the package produces exactly the same /var/qmail hierarchy as a
user would obtain by downloading, compiling, and installing qmail-1.03.tar.gz,
fastforward-0.51.tar.gz, and dot-forward-0.71.tar.gz; 
(2) the package behaves correctly, i.e., the same way as normal 
qmail+fastforward+dot-forward installations on all other systems; 
and (3) the package's creator warrants that he has made a good-faith attempt
to ensure that the package behaves correctly. It is not acceptable to have
qmail working differently on different machines; any variation is a bug. 
If there's something about a system (compiler, libraries, kernel, hardware, 
whatever) that changes qmail's behavior, then that platform is not supported, 
and you are not permitted to distribute binaries.
