Note:

  This copyright does NOT cover user programs that run in CLISP and
  third-party packages not part of CLISP, if
    a) They only reference external symbols in CLISP's public packages
       that define API also provided by many other Common Lisp implementations
       (namely the packages COMMON-LISP, COMMON-LISP-USER, KEYWORD, CLOS,
       GRAY, EXT), i.e. if they don't rely on CLISP internals and would as
       well run in any other Common Lisp implementation. Or
    b) They only reference external symbols in CLISP's public packages
       that define API also provided by many other Common Lisp implementations
       (namely the packages COMMON-LISP, COMMON-LISP-USER, KEYWORD, CLOS,
       GRAY, EXT) and some external, not CLISP specific, symbols in
       third-party packages that are released with source code under a
       GPL compatible license and that run in a great number of Common Lisp
       implementations, i.e. if they rely on CLISP internals only to the
       extent needed for gaining some functionality also available in a
       great number of Common Lisp implementations.
  Such user programs are not covered by the term "derived work" used in
  the GNU GPL. Neither is their compiled code, i.e. the result of compiling
  them by use of the function COMPILE-FILE. We refer to such user programs
  as "independent work".

  You may copy and distribute memory image files generated by the
  function SAVEINITMEM, if it was generated only from CLISP and independent
  work, and provided that you accompany them, in the sense of section 3
  of the GNU GPL, with the source code of CLISP - precisely the same CLISP
  version that was used to build the memory image -, the source or compiled
  code of the user programs needed to rebuild the memory image (source
  code for all the parts that are not independent work, see above), and
  a precise description how to rebuild the memory image from these.

  Foreign non-Lisp code that is linked with CLISP or loaded into CLISP
  through dynamic linking is not exempted from this copyright. I.e. such
  code, when distributed for use with CLISP, must be distributed under
  the GPL.
