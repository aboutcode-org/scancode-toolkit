Guidance for Use of X12 Content in Artifacts Based on X12 TR3s

Many organizations produce artifacts which contain proprietary instructions for creating transactions based on an associated X12 Type 3 Technical Report (TR3), also known as an X12 Implementation Guide (IG). Such artifacts are often called Companion Guides. These artifacts must adhere to U.S. Copyright laws and X12 IP policies.

This section outlines the requirements for artifacts that use or are based on the contents of TR3s. These requirements supplement, but do not replace or overrule, the associated copyrights and X12's Fair Use policies. Artifacts must conform to these restrictions to avoid infringing on X12 copyrights and related intellectual property rights.

It is recognized that artifacts may also include information that is unrelated to X12 intellectual property; X12 has no jurisdiction over that portion of an artifact and does not review that information during an IP Review.

Content Guidelines

Such Artifacts must:

Abide by US Copyright Law.

Abide by X12's Fair Use and Copyright policies.

Correctly identify the X12 organization and any referenced X12 products. Include a statement about where to purchase a license for the underlying TR3 and the associated URL.

Example: The X12 TR3 that details the full requirements for this transaction can be licensed at x12.org/licensing.

Include a disclaimer that the TR3 retains ultimate authority over the requirements of the transmission.

Example: Every effort has been made to ensure consistency between this document and the X12 TR3. However, if there is a discrepancy between the documents, the X12 TR3 is the final authority.

Be used in conjunction with an associated X12 TR3; they must not be stand-alone requirements documents

Conform to all the requirements of the associated TR3. Use the full official name, including the unique identifier, at the first reference to any TR3.

Example: X12/006020X267 Health Care Claim Status Request and Response (276/277). If a shortened TR3 title will be used in the Artifact, it may either be the unique identifier or the TR3 name.

Example: 006020X267, 6020X212 or Health Care Claim Status Request and Response. Once permission for use of X12 copyrighted material has been granted, the Artifact must include a statement at the beginning of the document noting "X12 has granted express permission for use of X12 copyrighted materials within this document."

Such Artifacts may:

Include proprietary information or instructions that clarify the TR3 instructions for specific trading partners.

Clarify a TR3 example, based on proprietary instructions. Add examples specific to proprietary instructions.

Clarify specific processing intentions related to TR3 requirements . Codes allowed in the TR3 must be accepted if transmitted however the Artifact may note that one or more codes from the TR3 code list are preferred or not processed.

"Not processed" means it will not be recognized in internal processing, it does not mean the transaction can be rejected if the code is transmitted. "Preferred" means that internal processes require a specific value, it does not mean the transaction can be rejected if the specified code is not transmitted. Clarification of the use of loops/segments/elements in the TR3 identified by situational rules stating trading partner requirements control usage: Examples of such situational rules:

"Required when the payer's adjudication is known to be impacted"

"Required when such transmission is required under the insurance contract" Indicate the number of repetitions which will be applied in the transaction processing application for loops or segments without repetition limitations in the TR3.

Identify trading partner information necessary to initiate or enable the communications between trading partners. Example: "GS02 â€“ send your TPID in this element".

Include information from X12 Requests for Interpretation (RFIs) as a reference for trading partner specific instructions as long as the RFI is explicitly referenced.

Artifacts must not:

Replicate the information presented in the associated TR3.

Contradict, countermand or duplicate any requirement of the associated TR3.

Contain material duplication of a section of the associated TR3, unless permission for the citation has been granted.

Add, modify or delete any requirements, including loop, segment or element names, notes or rules, examples, appendix, or code list subsets from Section 2 of the associated TR3.

Use the unique identifier listed in GS08 unless the transaction conforms to the requirements documented in the associated TR3, within the parameters of the Compliance in X12 document.

Add, modify or disallow any defining, explanatory, or clarifying content (within Section 1), example (within Sections 2 and 3) or Appendix (within Section 4). Include tutorial information about X12 syntax, the underlying transaction set or related transaction sets.

Guidance for Use of X12 Materials in Artifacts Based on Any Other X12 Product Many organizations produce artifacts which contain proprietary instructions for creating transactions based on an X12 product. Such artifacts must adhere to U.S. Copyright laws and X12 IP policies.

A separate section outlines the requirements for artifacts based on X12 TR3s. This section outlines the requirements for artifacts that use or are based on all other X12 products. These requirements supplement, but do not replace or overrule, the associated copyrights and X12's Fair Use statement. Artifacts must conform to these restrictions to avoid infringing on X12 copyrights and related intellectual property rights. Artifacts may also include information that is unrelated to X12 products; X12 has no jurisdiction over that portion of an artifact and does not review that information during an IP Review.

These artifacts must adhere to U.S. Copyright laws and X12 IP policies.

This section outlines the requirements for citing, or exactly quoting, X12 copyrighted content in an artifact. These requirements supplement, but do not replace or overrule, the associated copyrights and X12's Fair Use statement.

Artifacts may also include information that is unrelated to X12 copyrighted content, X12 has no jurisdiction over that portion of the artifact and does not review that information during an IP Review.

Citation Format

The basic style below is adapted from the Modern Language Association (MLA) Style Manual and by convention includes line breaks and an indent for each successive line:

Author Name. "Title: Subtitle, Figure number, if appropriate, Segment ID - Name, if appropriate." Title of Book, identifier. Publisher, Date of publication. . Page Number(s) [if applicable].

Examples

If someone wants to reproduce figure 1.1 of 006020X258, the choices are:

Place a footnote reference number in relation to the reproduced figure and place the following as the footnote, or place the following directly below the figure:

Accredited Standards Committee X12, Insurance Subcommittee, X12N. "1.4.1 Information Flows, Fig. 1.1." Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (835), 006020X258. X12 Incorporated, June 2012. . 3.

Or place in-line with the text an abbreviated citation:

The 835 presents an "Information Flow" figure, reproduced below, illustrating the flow of information from payer to payee (006020X258 1).

The style above requires that a works-cited list be created and placed at the end of the document. Each citation is assigned a number. In the example above, the 1 refers to the first citation in the list; which appears in the works cited list like this:

Accredited Standards Committee X12, Insurance Subcommittee, X12N. "1.4.1 Information Flows, Fig. 1.1." Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (835), 006020X258. X12 Incorporated, June 2012. . 3.

A span of page numbers is appropriate when the quoted material is on consecutive pages. For example, to refer to the payer business contact information segment:

Accredited Standards Committee X12, Insurance Subcommittee, X12N. "PER â€“ Payer Business Contact Information." Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (835), 006020X258. X12 Incorporated, June 2012. . 94-96.
