greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further 
Modifications or combinations 

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Application of License. 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are 
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation 
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be 
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future 
version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must 
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code 
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source 
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of 
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may 
include an additional document offering the additional rights 
described in Section 3.5. 

3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must 
be made available, prior to any use, except for internal 
development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of 
this License either on the same media as an Executable version or 
via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom 
you made an Executable version available; and if made available via 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at 
least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became 
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of 
that particular Modification has been made available to such 
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the 
Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact 
means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial 
Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may 
provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification 
to be made available. 

3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain 
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code 
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement 
that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from 
Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the 
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in 
any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in 
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 

(a) Third Party Claims. 
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual 
property right in particular functionality or code (or its 
utilization under this License), you must include a text 
file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which 
describes the claim and the party making the claim in 
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to 
contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your 
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You 
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make 
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as 
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) 
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 

(b) Representations. 

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to 
Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original 
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the 
Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source 
Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered 
Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your 
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it 
is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file 
due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a 
location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be 
likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation 
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred 
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the 
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered 
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code 
version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this 
License, including a description of how and where You have 
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, 
related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute 
the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your 
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License 
and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the 
Executable version under a different license You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are 
offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any 
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 
offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered 
Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the 
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product. 

3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other 
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the 
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure 
the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered 
Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to 
statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of 
this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of 
the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully 
with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they 
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited 
by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently 
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand 
it. 

5. Application of this License. 

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has 
attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 

6. Versions of the License. 

6.1. New Versions. 
License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to 
opensource.org for certification. 

6.2. Effect of New Versions. 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of 
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of 
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under 
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by 
Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under 
this License. 

6.3. Derivative Works. 
If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in 
association with the required Developer Specific License described 
in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code 
which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you 
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', 
``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear 
anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your 
version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open 
Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, 
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A 
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
License.) 

6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License 

This license is a union of the following two parts that should be 
found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of 
preeminence: 

[1] A Developer specific license. 

[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general 
licensing policy of the software. 

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, 
the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by 
the terms of the higher numbered part. 

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF 
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE 
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART 
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER 
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

8. TERMINATION. 

8.1 Termination upon Breach 

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure 
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All 
sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall 
survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their 
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
shall survive. 



8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by 
asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred 
to as "Participant") alleging that: 

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt 
of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a 
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future 
use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw 
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually 
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim 
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You 
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such 
Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked 
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, 
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that 
Participant. 

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant 
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as 
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
license. 

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all 
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) 
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination shall survive termination. 



9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND 
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF 
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer 
software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such 
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), 
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those 
rights set forth herein.

This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this 
section are found in the corresponding addendum described above. 

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with 
Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, 
based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the 
revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with 
Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.
