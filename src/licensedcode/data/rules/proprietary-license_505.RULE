            COPYRIGHT STATEMENT FOR ZOO ARCHIVE PROGRAM

1.   "This software" refers separately to each existing version, and
     each existing authorized derivative work, of my zoo archive
     program as of the date at the bottom of this copyright statement.

2.   DISTRIBUTION IN UNMODIFIED FORM:  You may copy this software in
     unmodified form for any purpose, whether commercial or
     noncommercial, provided that you make no attempt to restrict
     distribution of it by others.

3.   CREATION OF DERIVATIVE WORKS:  You may create and distribute
     derivative works made from any source code files that are part of
     this software, provided that you (a) preserve all copyright
     notices and author attributions, (b) do not create, whether
     deliberately or through negligence, any derivative work that
     violates the compatibility goals describe in the reference manual
     for zoo 2.1, (c) do not attempt to restrict the distribution or
     use of the derivative work by others, (d) make the fully commented
     source code of the derivative work available to me at no cost if
     I so request, and make no attempt to restrict the distribution
     or use of this source code.

4.   NO WARRANTY.  I make no claim that this software is free of defects.
     I do not accept any legal obligation to provide any bug fixes or
     any other type of support whatsoever.  I disclaim all liability
     for damages, whether direct or consequential.

5.   EXCEPTIONS:  Exceptions to the above conditions are probably
     possible.  Please contact me to negotiate.

6.   The prohibition against incompatible derivative works does not 
     necessarily imply that the archiver and the archive format cannot
     be enhanced.  However, if any incompatibility is created, it may
     be done only with my permission.
