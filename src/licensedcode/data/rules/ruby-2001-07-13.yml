    This replaced the GPL COPYING file with the ruby dual licensing terms 
    This came just after a short lived modification that lived only for 2 days
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby/ruby/cbc3756009999e58d717af4fc82ba6c33bd3e7e6/COPYING
    Before this the ruby license was in the README
    https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/d0cf53ffb494469d40be95eb97decdb86c95f653/README
    and the bottom of section 4. was changed on a regular bassis to update the list
    of files and minor typos.
    The Ruby license was first introduced there in early 1998
