For all purposes of this Agreement, the words ?including? and ?includes? mean inclusion without limitation. Any legal or equitable principles that might require or permit the construction of this Agreement or any provision hereof against the party drafting this Agreement will not apply in any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.eastwin
