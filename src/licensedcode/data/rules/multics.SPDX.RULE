Multics License

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is
provided and donated to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group
BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. as a contribution to
computer science knowledge. This donation is made also to give evidence
of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems
Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems
Inc. to the development of this operating system. Multics development
was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC
(1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of
Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the
best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly and
for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems incorporated
Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group
Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., as
successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and
Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
