Copyright:      The copyright owner must agree to use of GPL.
                It's best if the submitter and copyright owner
                are the same person/entity. If not, the name of
                the person/entity authorizing use of GPL should be
                listed in case it's necessary to verify the will of
                the copyright owner.
