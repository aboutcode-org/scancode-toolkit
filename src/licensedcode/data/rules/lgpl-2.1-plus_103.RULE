Anything that ends up being part of the  library needs to be released
under LGPLv2.1+ or a license compatible with it (though the latter will
only be accepted for cases where the code originated elsewhere and was
imported into ).

Language bindings for the libraries need to be released under LGPLv2.1+.

Anything else (non-libaries) needs to be Free Software and needs to be
allowed to link with LGPLv2.1+ code (if needed). LC upstream prefers
LGPLv2.1+ or GPLv2 for those.
