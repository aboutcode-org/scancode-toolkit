the project has chosen to use only the BSD
license option for future distribution. As such, the GPL v2 license
option is no longer used and the contributions are not required to be
licensed until GPL v2. In case of most files in hostap.git, "under the
open source license indicated in the file" means that the contribution
is licensed under the modified BSD license (see below).
