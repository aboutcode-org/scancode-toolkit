  Use is subject to license terms.

For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
is applied is otherwise unspecified.
