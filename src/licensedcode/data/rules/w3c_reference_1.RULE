This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August 14 1998 so as to improve compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that W3C software licensing terms are no more restrictive than GPL and consequently W3C software may be distributed in GPL packages. See the older formulation for the policy prior to this date.
