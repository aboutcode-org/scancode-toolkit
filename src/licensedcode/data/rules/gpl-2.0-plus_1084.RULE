distributed under the terms of the {{GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version
2, or (at your option) any later version}}.

This means it is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
I<without any warranty>; without even the implied warranty of
I<merchantability> or I<fitness for a particular purpose>.  See the
{{GNU General Public License}} for more details.

Since Perl scripts are only compiled at runtime, and simply calling
 does I<not> bring your program under the GPL, the only
real restriction is that you can't use  in an
binary-only distribution produced with C<dump> (unless you also
provide source code).
