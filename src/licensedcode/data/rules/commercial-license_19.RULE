Red Hat 
Enterprise Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING AND/OR USING SOFTWARE OR SERVICES FROM RED HAT. BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, CLIENT SIGNIFIES ITS ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGES IT HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF CLIENT DOES NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN IT MUST NOT USE RED HAT SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. This Agreement incorporates those appendices at the end of this Agreement.

This Red Hat Enterprise Agreement, including all referenced appendices and documents located at URLs (the "Agreement"), is between Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") and the purchaser or user of Red Hat software and services who accepts the terms of this Agreement ("Client"). The effective date of this Agreement ("Effective Date") is the earlier of the date that Client signs or accepts this Agreement or the date that Client uses Red Hat''s software or services.

Scope of Agreement
1.1 Framework. This Agreement establishes a framework that will enable Red Hat to provide Software and Services to Client. "Software" means Red Hat Enterprise Linux, JBoss Enterprise Middleware and other software programs branded by Red Hat, its Affiliates and/or third parties including all modifications, additions or further enhancements delivered by Red Hat. The specific services (the "Services") and/or Software that Red Hat will provide to Client will be described in an Order Form, signed by the parties or otherwise accepted by Red Hat, which may consist of (a) one or more mutually agreed order forms, statements of work, work orders or similar transaction documents, or (b) an order placed by Client through Red Hat''s online store accessible from a Red Hat website. The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement will govern all purchases and use by Client of Software and Services unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.

1.2 Affiliates. Red Hat and Client agree that Affiliates of Client may acquire Software and Services from Red Hat or its Affiliates by entering an Order Form with Red Hat (or a Red Hat Affiliate) that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that adjustments to the terms of this Agreement may be made in a particular Order Form (for example, to address disparate tax and/or legal regimes in other geographic regions). "Affiliate" means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common control or ownership with a party, where "control" is the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

1.3 Business Partners. Red Hat has entered into agreements with other organizations ("Business Partners") to promote, market and support certain Software and Services. When Client purchases Software and Services through a Business Partner, Red Hat confirms that it is responsible for providing the Software and Services to Client under the terms of this Agreement. Red Hat is not responsible for (a) the actions of Business Partners, (b) any additional obligations Business Partners have to Client, or (c) any products or services that Business Partners supply to Client under any separate agreements between a Business Partner and Client.

Obligations of the Parties
2.1 On-Site Obligations. If Red Hat personnel are working on Client''s premises (a) Client will provide a safe and secure working environment for Red Hat personnel, and (b) Red Hat will comply with all reasonable workplace safety and security standards and policies, applicable to Client''s employees, of which Red Hat is notified in writing by Client in advance.

2.2 Changes to Work and Delays. Changes to the Services will be made only through a written change order signed by both parties. In the event that (a) Client fails to timely fulfill its obligations under an Order Form, and this failure adversely impacts the provision of Services, or (b) events outside of either party''s reasonable control cause a delay in or otherwise affect Red Hat''s ability to perform its obligations under an Order Form, Red Hat will be entitled to appropriate relief, including adjusting the timing of its delivery of applicable Services.

2.3 Assistance. Client may provide Red Hat access to Client information, systems, and software ("Client Information"), and resources such as workspace, network access, and telephone connections as reasonably required by Red Hat in order to provide the Services. Client understands and agrees that (a) the completeness, accuracy of, and extent of access to, any Client Information provided to Red Hat may affect Red Hat''s ability to provide Services, and (b) if reasonable access to Client Information is not provided, Red Hat will be relieved from providing any Services dependent upon such access. Client will obtain any third party consents necessary to grant Red Hat access to the Client Information that is subject to the proprietary rights of, or controlled by, any third party, or which is subject to any other form of restriction upon disclosure.

Payment
3.1 Fees and Expenses. Fees for the Services (the "Fees") will be identified in an Order Form and are (a) due upon Red Hat''s acceptance of an Order Form or, for renewal of Services, at the start of the renewal term, and (b) payable in accordance with Section 3.2. Fees are stated in United States Dollars, must be paid in United States Dollars, and, unless otherwise specified in writing, do not include out-of-pocket expenses or shipping costs. Client will reimburse Red Hat for all reasonable expenses Red Hat incurs in connection with the performance of Services. Client agrees to pay Red Hat the applicable Fees for each Unit. "Unit" is the measurement of Software or Service usage defined in the applicable Order Form. Any renewal of Subscription Services will be at the same price per Unit listed in the applicable Order Form. "Subscription Services" mean fee-bearing subscriptions for a defined period of time for a certain scope of Services.

3.2 Invoices
3.2.1 If Client desires credit terms with respect to the payment of Fees, Client will reasonably cooperate with Red Hat in establishing and periodically re-confirming Client''s credit-worthiness. If credit terms are provided to Client, Red Hat will invoice Client for the Fees upon Red Hat''s acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form and subject to Red Hat''s approval of credit terms, Client will pay Fees and expenses, if any, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of each invoice; provided, however, that Fees for professional services, training, training credits and other service credits are due prior to delivery. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Client pursuant to this Agreement are non-refundable. Red Hat reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

3.2.2   If Client is paying by credit card, Client (a) authorizes Red Hat to charge Client''s credit card for the Services and for the amount due at the time of renewal of Subscription Services, and (b) agrees to provide updated credit card information to Red Hat for renewal purposes.

3.3 Taxes. All Fees are exclusive of Taxes. Client will pay Red Hat an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement or an applicable Order Form which are paid by or are payable by Red Hat. "Taxes" means any form of sales, use, value added or other form of taxation and any fines, penalties, surcharges or interest, but excluding any taxes based solely on the net income of Red Hat. If Client is required to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Red Hat, Client will increase the sum payable to Red Hat by the amount necessary so that Red Hat receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Client made no withholdings or deductions.

License and Ownership
4.1 Software. Each type of Software is governed by a license grant or an end user license agreement, which license terms are contained or referenced in the appendices to this Agreement or the applicable Order Form.

4.2 Freedom to Use Ideas. Subject to Section 9 and Client''s rights in Client Information and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or an Order Form, the ideas, methods, concepts, know-how, structures, techniques, inventions, developments, processes, discoveries, improvements and other information and materials developed in and during the course of any Order Form may be used by Red Hat, without an obligation to account, in any way Red Hat deems appropriate, including by or for itself or its clients or customers.

4.3 Marks. Unless expressly stated in an Order Form, no right or license, express or implied, is granted in this Agreement for the use of any Red Hat, Red Hat Affiliate, Client or third party trade names, service marks or trademarks, including, without limitation, the distribution of the Software utilizing any Red Hat or Red Hat Affiliate trademarks.

Reporting and Inspection
5.1 Reporting. Client will notify Red Hat (or the Business Partner from whom Client purchased Software or Services) promptly if the actual number of Units of Software or Services utilized by Client exceeds the number of Units for which Client has paid the applicable Fees. In its notice, Client will include the number of additional Units and the date(s) on which such Units were first utilized. Red Hat (or the Business Partner) will invoice Client for the applicable Services for such Units and Client will pay for such Services no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.

5.2 Inspection. During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, Red Hat or its designated agent may inspect Client''s facilities and records to verify Client''s compliance with this Agreement. Any such inspection will take place only during Client''s normal business hours and upon no less than ten (10) days prior written notice from Red Hat. Red Hat will give Client written notice of any noncompliance, including the number of underreported Units of Software or Services, and Client will have fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice to make payment to Red Hat for the applicable Services provided with respect to the underreported Units. If Client underreports the number of Units utilized by more than five percent (5%) of the number of Units for which Client paid, Client will also pay Red Hat for the cost of such inspection.

Term and Termination
6.1 Term and Termination of Agreement. The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will terminate at the expiration of ninety (90) days following written notice of termination given by one party to the other. Termination of this Agreement will not operate to terminate any Order Form and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect to the extent necessary to give effect to any Order Form in effect at the time of termination of this Agreement and until such time as the applicable Order Form expires or is terminated in accordance with Section 6.2 below.

6.2 Term and Termination of Order Form
6.2.1   The term of an Order Form begins on the date the Order Form is executed ("Order Form Effective Date") and continues for the term stated in the Order Form. Thereafter, the term for Subscription Services will automatically renew for successive terms of one (1) year each, unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intention not to renew at least sixty (60) days before the commencement of the next renewal term. Client must use any other Services set forth in an Order Form during the term specified in the Order Form or within one (1) year of the Order Form Effective Date, whichever is shorter; if unused, such Services will be forfeited.

6.2.2   If Client or Red Hat materially breaches the terms of an Order Form, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, by giving written notice of termination to the breaching party, terminate the applicable Order Form and/or this Agreement; provided, however, that no cure period will be required for a breach of Section 9 of this Agreement. The termination of an individual Order Form will not terminate any other Order Form or this Agreement unless otherwise specified in the written notice of termination. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy of Red Hat, in the event either party terminates an Order Form, Client will pay Red Hat (or the Business Partner from whom Client purchased such Software or Services) for all Services provided up to the effective date of termination.

6.3 Survival. If this Agreement or an Order Form is terminated for any reason, Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 6.3, 7, 8, 9, 10.2, 12, 13.1, 13.5-13.14, and 14 of this Agreement (as the same are incorporated into each Order Form) will survive such termination.

Continuing Business
Nothing in this Agreement will preclude or limit Red Hat from providing software, materials, or services for itself or other clients, irrespective of the possible similarity of such software, materials or services to those that might be delivered to Client. The terms of confidentiality in Section 9 will not prohibit or restrict either party''s right to develop, use or market products or services similar to or competitive with the other party; provided, however, that neither party is relieved of its obligations under this Agreement.
