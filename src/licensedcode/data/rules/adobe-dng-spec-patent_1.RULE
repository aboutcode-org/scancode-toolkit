Digital Negative (DNG) Specification patent license
Adobe is the publisher of the Digital Negative (DNG) Specification
describing an image file format for storing camera raw information
used in a wide range of hardware and software. Adobe provides the DNG
Specification to the public for the purpose of encouraging
implementation of this file format in a compliant manner. This
document is a patent license granted by Adobe to individuals and
organizations that desire to develop, market, and/or distribute
hardware and software that reads and/or writes image files compliant
with the DNG Specification.
Grant of rights
Subject to the terms below and solely to permit the reading and
writing of image files that comply with the DNG Specification, Adobe
hereby grants all individuals and organizations the worldwide,
royalty-free, nontransferable, nonexclusive right under all Essential
Claims to make, have made, use, sell, import, and distribute Compliant
Implementations.
“Compliant Implementation” means a portion of a software or hardware
product that reads or writes computer files compliant with the DNG
Specification.
“DNG Specification” means any version of the Adobe DNG Specification
made publicly available by Adobe (for example, version 1.0.0.0 dated
September 2004).
“Essential Claim” means a claim of a patent, whenever and wherever
issued, that Adobe has the right to license without payment of royalty
or other fee that is unavoidably infringed by implementation of the
DNG Specification. A claim is unavoidably infringed by the DNG
Specification only when it is not possible to avoid infringing when
conforming with such specification because there is no technically
possible noninfringing alternative for achieving such conformity.
Essential Claim does not include a claim that is infringed by
implementation of (a) enabling technology that may be necessary to
make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the DNG
Specification but is not itself expressly set forth in the DNG
Specification (for example, compiler technology and basic operating
system technology), (b) technology developed elsewhere and merely
incorporated by reference in the DNG Specification, or (c) the
implementation of file formats other than DNG.
Revocation
Adobe may revoke the rights granted above to any individual or
organizational licensee in the event that such licensee or its
affiliates brings any patent action against Adobe or its affiliates
related to the reading or writing of files that comply with the DNG
Specification.
Any Compliant Implementation distributed under this license must
include the following notice displayed in a prominent manner within
its source code and documentation: "This product includes DNG
technology under license by Adobe Systems Incorporated.”
No warranty
The rights granted herein are provided on an as-is basis without
warranty of any kind, including warranty of title or noninfringement.
Nothing in this license shall be construed as (a) requiring the
maintenance of any patent, (b) a warranty or representation as to the
validity or scope of any patent, (c) a warranty or representation that
any product or service will be free from infringement of any patent,
(d) an agreement to bring or prosecute actions against any infringers
of any patent, or (e) conferring any right or license under any patent
claim other than Essential Claims.
Reservation of rights
All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
