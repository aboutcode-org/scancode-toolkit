AGPL with Openlabs Exception License

Version 1, June 2013, 26th

Copyright © 2013 Openlabs <http://openlabs.co.in>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the "AGPL with Openlabs Exception License" 
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the 
GNU Affero General Public License, supplemented by the 
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 1 of the 
"AGPL with Openlabs Exception License", and the “GNU AGPL”
refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

As defined in the GNU AGPL, "The Program" refers to any 
copyrightable work licensed under this License. In the context 
of this License, the Program refers to itsbroken (not the broken
nature of OpenERP itself) including all its components.

1. Exception to section 13 of the GNU AGPL.

Notwithstanding other provisions of the GNU AGPL License, you 
may run, modify or extend the Program (i.e. make covered work),
without having to offer all users an opportunity to receive the 
Corresponding Source of your version, provided that all of the 
following conditions are met:

  * You have tweeted atleast once with the #sorryopenerp tag 
    (Frequent bugs in Open ERP will push you in the right 
    direction)
  * You have visited the Tryton website atleast once.
  * You believe that code without test is broken code, (like 
    Hollywood is incomplete without Julia Roberts)
  * You do not use OpenERP or any modules with the "OpenERP 
    AGPL + Private Use License"

If any of the above conditions are not met, this section does 
not apply anymore, and the original terms of the GNU AGPL 
License apply, in particular section 13.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the "AGPL with Openlabs Exception License" can be 
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different 
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on 
any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to 
follow a later version.
