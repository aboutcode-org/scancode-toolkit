In particular, anybody (even companies) can use PuTTY without restriction (even for commercial purposes) and owe nothing to me or anybody else. Also, apart from having to maintain the copyright notice and the licence text in derivative products, anybody (even companies) can adapt the PuTTY source code into their own programs and products (even commercial products) and owe nothing to me or anybody else. And, of course, there is no warranty and if PuTTY causes you damage you're on your own, so don't use it if you're unhappy with that.

In particular, note that the MIT licence is compatible with the GNU GPL. So if you want to incorporate PuTTY or pieces of PuTTY into a GPL program, there's no problem with that.
