    If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
    network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get
    its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its
    interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of
    the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
    solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
    specific requirements.
