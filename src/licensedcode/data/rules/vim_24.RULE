Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  Please see the
kcc section of the vim docs or visit the ICCF web site, available at these URLs:

   http://iccf-holland.org/
   http://www.vim.org/iccf/

You can also sponsor the development of Vim.  Vim sponsors can vote for
features.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.
