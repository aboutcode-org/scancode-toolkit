The following terms and conditions govern the use of Progress Telerik Fiddler Web Debugger (the “Software”).  By using any of the Software and/or any updates to it, you indicate your acceptance of these terms. If you do not accept these terms, do not install or use the software.
The Software and any updates to it are provided "as is" and you bear the risk of using it. In no event shall Progress Software Corporation (“Progress”), its affiliates, or its licensors, be liable for any consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind arising out of the delivery, performance or use of the Software. The Software was written with care, but no one warrants that the Software is error-free. Your sole remedy for any failure or any form of damage caused by the Software is a full refund of the license fee we have received from you, which in all cases is $0.
On startup, the Software anonymously checks for new versions; you may disable this feature if you prefer. We collect anonymous data about your system configuration and use of the Software to help improve future versions of the Software.  This may include information relating to certain features and extensions of the Software, identifying trends and bugs, activation information, usage statistics and may track other data related to your use of the Software as further described in the most current version of Progress’ Privacy Policy (located at: https://www.progress.com/legal/privacy-policy).  This does not include any data that can be used to identify you, either directly or indirectly.  If you would like to disable this feature, you may do so in the Options dialog. You may be asked, from time to time, to respond to short survey questions presented within the Software’s user environment. Progress may use your responses to these questions to serve you with targeted advertising content, to improve the Software, and/or for other purposes as described within the Privacy Policy. By your responding to such questions, opting-in to data collection, and/or acceptance of these terms and/or use of the Software, you authorize the collection, use and disclosure of all responses and data for the purposes provided for herein and/or in the Privacy Policy. You may privately distribute copies of the Software to others, so long as this disclaimer accompanies said distribution, you do not represent the Software as your own work, and you do not alter the Software or the installation package in any way. You may not host or redistribute this Software publicly (e.g. from a public Internet site); instead point users to http://getfiddler.com/ to download.
