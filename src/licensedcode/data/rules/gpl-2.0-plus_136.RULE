Note: This code is heavily based on the GNU MP Library.
      Actually it's the same code with only minor changes in the
      way the data is stored; this is to support the abstraction
      of an optional secure memory allocation which may be used
      to avoid revealing of sensitive data due to paging etc.
      The GNU MP Library itself is published under the LGPL;
      however I decided to publish this code under the plain GPL.
