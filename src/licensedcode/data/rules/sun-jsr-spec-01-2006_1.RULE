1. License for Evaluation Purposes. BEA hereby grants you a fully-paid, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without 
the right to sublicense), under BEA's applicable intellectual property 
rights to view, download, use and reproduce the Specification only for 
the purpose of internal evaluation, which shall be understood to 
include developing applications intended to run on an implementation of 
the Specification provided that such applications do not themselves 
implement any portion(s) of the Specification.  

2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. BEA also 
grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, 
fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sub
license) under  any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions 
of subsection 3 below, patent rights it may have covering the 
Specification to create and/or distribute an implementation of the 
Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification including 
all its required interfaces and functionality, (b) does not modify, 
subset, superset or otherwise extend the Sun Name Space, or include any 
public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or 
methods within the Sun Name Space other than those  required/authorized 
by the Specification or Specifications being implemented and  (c) 
passes the Technology Compatibility Kit  for such Specification 
("Compliant Implementation"). 



3. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.  

	a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license 
granted under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all 
technically feasible implementations of the Specification, such license 
is conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent 
rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible 
implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a 
Compliant Implementation. 


	b  With respect to any patent claims owned by BEA and covered by 
the license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their 
infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when 
implementing the Specification, such license shall terminate with 
respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against BEA that it has, 
in the course of performing its responsibilities as the Specification 
Lead, induced any other entity to infringe Your patent rights.

	c  Also with respect to any patent claims owned by BEA and 
covered by the license granted under subparagraph, where the 
infringement of such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible 
manner when implementing the Specification such license, with respect 
to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against BEA 
that its making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or 
importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.

4.  Downstream Licenses for Compliant Implementations.  A Downstream 
Licensee need not include limitations (a)-(c) from Section 2, above, or 
any other particular "pass through" requirements in any license the 
Downstream Licensee grants concerning the use of its Compliant  
Implementation or products derived from it. However, except with 
respect to implementations of the Specification (and products derived 
from them) by the Downstream Licensee's licensee that satisfy 
requirements (a)-(c) from Section 2, above, the Downstream Licensee may 
neither:  (a) grant or otherwise pass through to its licensees any 
licensable copyrights and patent rights of BEA; nor (b) authorize its 
licensees to make any claims concerning their implementation's 
compliance with the Specification in question.

5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Technology 
Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying 
documentation provided by BEA which corresponds to the particular 
version of the Specification being tested; "Sun Name Space" shall mean 
the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with 
"java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent 
naming convention adopted by Sun Microsystems, Inc., through the Java 
Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements 
thereof; "Downstream Licensee" shall mean a company or individual that 
creates an Compliant Implementation under this Agreement.
