notes: this is a rare variant of the artistic 1.0 with extra woring in Clause 7 "7. C subroutines
    supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables
    of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but
    are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change
    the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language."
