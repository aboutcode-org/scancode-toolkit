    "7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
    emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall
    not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in
    Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way
    that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language."
