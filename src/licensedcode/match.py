"""
LicenseMatch data structure and processing.
A key feature is merging and filtering of matches.

Merging combines match fragments made to the same license rule and that in the
correct sequence.

Filtering discards matches based on various heuristics and rules such as:

- containment: a small match is contained in a larger match
- overlap: based on a level of overlap between matches
- various spurious matches rules based on length, required content, etc.
- false positives

The filter functions are executed in a specific sequence over the list of matches.

    License detection match to a rule with matched query positions and lines and

    a match behaves a little like a Span and has several similar methods taking
    into account both the query and index-side Spans.

    Note that the relationship between the query-side qspan Span and the index-
    side ispan Span is such that:

    - they always have the exact same number of items but when sorted each
      value at a given index may be different
    - the nth position when sorted by position is such that their token
      value is equal for this position.

    zip(). Also and as a convention throughout, we always use qspan first then
    ispan: in general we put query-related variables on the left hand side and
    index-related variables on the right hand side.
