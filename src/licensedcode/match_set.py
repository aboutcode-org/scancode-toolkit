"""
Approximate matching strategies using token sets and multisets.

This is used as a pre-filter to find candidates rules that have the highest
likeliness of matching a query and to filter rules that could not possibly yield
a valid match. The candidates rules are later for pair-wise matching with the
query. This way either less or no matching is needed.

We collect a subset of rules that could be matched by ranking them and keep the
top candidates. We also filter out rules based on minimum thresholds such as
matched token occurrences or an approximation of the length of a match.

The primary technique is token ids sets and multisets intersections. We compute
a resemblance and containment based on these set intersections that is used as
vector to rank. This is essentially a traditional IR inverted index approach.

But we also want to return every matches and not just probabilistic top-ranked
matches based on frequencies as is typically done in a search engine. There2fore
we compute the intersection of the query against every rules. This proves more
efficient than a traditional inverted intersection in part because the queries
are much larger (1000's of tokens) than a traditional search engine query.

Since we use integers to represent tokens, we reduce the problem to integer set
or multisets/bags/counters intersections. Furthermore, we have a finite and
limited number of tokens.

Two techniques are used in sequence: tokens sets and multisets.

Tokens occurrence sets
======================

A tokens occurrence set is represented as an array of bits (aka. a bitmap) where
each bit position corresponds to a token id. The length of each bit array is
therefore equal to the number of unique tokens across all rules. This forms a
term occurrence matrix stored compactly as bitmaps. With about 15K unique tokens
and about 6k rules, we store about 90 millions bits (15K x 6K) for about 10MB
of total storage for this matrix. Computing intersections of bitmaps is fast
even if it needs to be done thousand times for each query and query run.

The length of the intersection of a query and rule bitmap tells us the count of
shared tokens. We can skip rules based on thresholds and we then rank and keep
the top rules.


Tokens ids  multisets aka. frequency counters aka. term vectors
===============================================================

A tokens frequency counter maps a token id to the number of times it shows up in
a text. This is also called a multiset or a bag or counter or a term vector.

Given the subset of ranked candidate rules from the token sets intersection
step, we intersect the query and rule token multisets. For each shared token we
collect the minimum count of a token present in both. We sum these to obtain an
approximation to the number of matchable tokens between the query and rule. This
is an approximation because it does not consider the relative positions of the
tokens so it may be bigger than what will eventually be matched using a sequence
alignment.

This sum is then used for the same filtering and ranking used for the token sets
step: skip if some threshold is not met and rank the candidates.

Finally we return the sorted top candidates.
