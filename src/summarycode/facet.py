Assign a facet to a file.

A facet is defined by zero or more glob/fnmatch expressions. Multiple facets can
be assigned to a file. The facets definition is a list of (facet, pattern) and a
file is assigned all thye facets that have a pattern defintion that match their
path.

Once all files have been assigned a facet, files without a facet are assigned to
the core facet.

The known facets are:

    - core - core files of a package. Used as default if no other facet apply.
    - data - data files of a package (such as CSV, etc).
    - dev - files used at development time (e.g. build scripts, dev tools, etc)
    - docs - Documentation files.
    - examples - Code example files.
    - tests - Test files and tools.
    - thirdparty - Embedded code from a third party (aka. vendored or bundled)
