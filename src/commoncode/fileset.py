"""
Match files and directories paths based on inclusion and exclusion glob-style
patterns.

For example, this can be used to skip files that match ignore patterns,
similar to a version control ignore files such as .gitignore.

The pattern syntax is the same as fnmatch(5) as implemented in Python.

Patterns are applied to a path this way:
 - Paths are converted to POSIX paths before matching.
 - Patterns are NOT case-sensitive.
 - Leading slashes are ignored.
 - If the pattern contains a /, then the whole path must be matched;
   otherwise, the pattern matches if any path segment matches.
 - When matched, a directory content is matched recursively.
   For instance, when using patterns for ignoring, a matched a directory will
   be ignore with its file and sub-directories at full depth.
 - The order of patterns does not matter.
 - Exclusion patterns are prefixed with an exclamation mark (band or !)
   meaning that matched paths by that pattern will be excluded. Exclusions
   have precedences of inclusions.
 - Patterns starting with # are comments and skipped. use [#] for a literal #.
 - to match paths relative to some root path, you must design your patterns
   and the path tested accordingly. This module does not handles this.

Patterns may include glob wildcards such as:
 - ? : matches any single character.
 - * : matches 0 or more characters.
 - [seq] : matches any character in seq
 - [!seq] :matches any character not in seq
For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example, '[?]'
matches the character '?'.
