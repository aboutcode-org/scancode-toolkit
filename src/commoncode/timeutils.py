    Return a timestamp representing the datetime object (assumed to be in UTC
    time) or the current UTC time (if dt == None) formatted using the ISO 8601
    standard as a basis, extended to be path safe.

    The Python isoformat returns a time stamp that complies with this standard
    but has limitations when used in a file or directory name. Here we
    transform the returned time stamp such that the result still complies with
    the ISO standard and can be safely used as part of a of file or directory
    name in a portable and OS safe fashion including on Windows where colons
    are not allowed in file names, or on posix where / denotes a path segment
    separator.

    For times, the ISO 8601 format specifies either a colon : (extended format)
    or nothing as a separator (basic format). Here Python defaults to using a
    colon. We therefore remove all the colons to be file system safe.

    Another character may show up in the ISO representation such as / for time
    intervals. We could replace the forward slash with a double hyphen (--) as
    a separator instead (see Section 4.4.2 of the ISO standard). However since
    there are several places where hyphens are used, this makes it difficult to
    parse back. Instead we use an _ (underscore) to make the time stamp easier
    to convert back to a datetime object.
