Scancode command lines examples:

(Note for Windows: use '\\' back slash instead of '/' forward slash for paths.)

Scan a single file for copyrights. Print scan results to stdout as JSON:

    scancode --copyright samples/zlib/zlib.h --json

Scan a single file for licenses, print verbose progress to stderr as each
file is scanned. Save scan to a JSON file:

    scancode --license --verbose samples/zlib/zlib.h --json licenses.json

Scan a directory explicitly for licenses and copyrights. Redirect JSON scan
results to a file:

    scancode --json -l -c samples/zlib/ > scan.json

Scan a directory while ignoring a single file.
Print scan results to stdout as JSON:

    scancode --json  --ignore README samples/

Scan a directory while ignoring all files with .txt extension.
Print scan results to stdout as JSON.
It is recommended to use quotes around glob patterns to prevent pattern
expansion by the shell:

    scancode --json --ignore "*.txt" samples/

Special characters supported in GLOB pattern:
- *       matches everything
- ?       matches any single character
- [seq]   matches any character in seq
- [!seq]  matches any character not in seq

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets.
For example, '[?]' matches the character '?'.
For details on GLOB patterns see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming).

Note: Glob patterns cannot be applied to path as strings.
For example, this will not ignore "samples/JGroups/licenses".

    scancode --json --ignore "samples*licenses" samples/


Scan a directory while ignoring multiple files (or glob patterns).
Print the scan results to stdout as JSON:

    scancode --json --ignore README --ignore "*.txt" samples/

Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights. Save scan results to
an HTML app file for interactive scan results navigation. When the scan is done,
open 'scancode_result.html' in your web browser. Note that additional app files
are saved in a directory named 'scancode_result_files':

    scancode --html-app scancode_result.html samples/

Scan a directory for licenses and copyrights. Save scan results to an
HTML file:

    scancode --html scancode_result.html samples/zlib

To extract archives, see the 'extractcode' command instead.

epilog_text = '''Examples (use --examples for more):

\b
Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and copyrights.
Save scan results to the 'scancode_result.json' JSON file:

    scancode --license --copyright --json=scancode_result.json samples

\b
Scan the 'samples' directory for licenses and package manifests. Print scan
results on screen as pretty-formatted JSON (using the special '-' FILE to print
to on screen/to stdout):

    scancode --json-pp - --license --package  samples

Note: when you run scancode, a progress bar is displayed with a counter of the
number of files processed. Use --verbose to display file-by-file progress.
